Elon Musk Is Not One Of Us. Stop Using Him As a Role Model.,34885,mntcz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mntcz3/elon_musk_is_not_one_of_us_stop_using_him_as_a/,2865,1618039855.0,"I’m tired of seeing him as a face of crypto in news. He is not one of us. He isn’t your average Joe. He is multi billionaire, one of the richest guys in the world. He doesn’t care about you, about me, about mine or your family. All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model. 
 
Stop giving him any reputation when it comes to crypto, this guy just shilled a shitcoin and thousands of people falls for it.",2021-04-10 02:30:55

Since this post blew up, and made its way on over to the /r/All sub-Reddit and most of them don't understand what is going on, I decided to make an edit with a video that pretty much sums up all of the bad actors and more mentioned in this post, so if you want a backstory, just watch this video from /u/dougpolkpoker for a better understanding: https://youtu.be/upPmNzcqFkU",2018-01-17 13:46:08
"""If I had bought BTC in the early 2010's at 10 cents, I would be a millionaire now"". Truth is: You would have sold long before BTC reached even its 2017 ATH of 20k USD.",20915,lijzxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lijzxr/if_i_had_bought_btc_in_the_early_2010s_at_10/,1512,1613190621.0,"Seeing things in hindsight makes you feel dumb, but the real truth is that back then nobody saw it coming. Only few, very few people really believed in BTC as a store of value or whatever. If you could go back in time and told people in 2010 that in 2021 hedge funds, S&P500 companies and even insurance companies are buying billions worth of BTC at 40k+ USD and using it as a store of value, everybody would just see you as the tin-foil hat person, laugh at you and call you mad and delusional.

This is the reason why I generally feel bad for those ""two pizzas are now worth X millions"" posts, as if the people who traded BTC for goods in the old days could predict the future. As such, the moment your holdings were at 10x your initial investment, very, very likely you would have sold as well, or just bought that awesome thing you could suddenly acquire with magic internet money.

That being said, do not punish yourself with the ""if I had"" thinking. Invest what you can and hold while you can. Taking profits is not a bad idea as well.",2021-02-12 22:30:21

While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch ""Sustainable"" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

**AN EXAMPLE**

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

Wall Street has decided you're not responsible enough to buy GME. This is why we need DeFi.,20024,l6wv0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l6wv0u/wall_street_has_decided_youre_not_responsible/,1103,1611870100.0,"For years, the crypto community has pointed to government control over fiat money as the reason Bitcoin needs to exist. People need an asset that they know can't be arbitrarily printed or controlled by corrupt governments.

And after 12 years, this narrative is taking hold. The financial industry is starting to take Bitcoin seriously, investors and large corporations are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet to reduce their dependency on the behavior of the US federal government.

**But the next fight is upon us.**

This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.

As of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in ""reduce only mode"".

Wall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.

Of course, hedge funds will still have access to GME and AMC. But not you.

**This is why Bitcoin is only the beginning of this revolution.**

It's not simply enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.

**This is why we need DeFi**

Nobody can turn off Uniswap. Nobody can turn off Aave. Nobody can turn off Synthetix.

Nobody can tell you that leverage-longing some shitcoin is irresponsible and you're not allowed to do it.

**This can be our moment.**

Thousands of people, from WSB to Twitter, have just been deplatformed, just for wanting to invest their money as they see fit.

Let's show them the future. Let's show them a world where finance is not owned by any government or hedge fund or billionaire.

A world where, as long as you're not hurting anyone, you're free to use your money however you like.",2021-01-28 15:41:40
A wallet is not what you think it is,20004,n1vwak,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n1vwak/a_wallet_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/,1715,1619824231.0,"If you're new to the space, here is a quick 101 on wallets.

Metamask, Electrum, MEW, Trust, Coinomi, Atomic or whatever other application you call a wallet is not really a wallet.

They are **wallet applications** that allow you to access and manage your cryptocurrency, NFTs or whatever blockchain asset you have stored in your wallet.

**Your wallet is your private key or seed phrase.**

For example:

* You download Metamask
* It gives you the option to create a seed phrase/private key
* The same seed phrase you can import to other applications like Trust, MEW, Atomic and your ETH will be accessible on both Metamask and those applications.

So next time you download a new wallet application, you don't have to create a new seed phrase, you can just import the one you already have to manage your existing funds in both applications.

Just thought I'd share this since I work in crypto and I noticed that a lot of users don't know this.

EDIT: I felt obliged to add that this is the reason you should never ever share your private keys with anyone. Your keys are your sole access to your assets on the blockchain so keep them secure.

Dogecoin is NOT a smart longterm investment. Here’s why.,18571,mrkpz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mrkpz4/dogecoin_is_not_a_smart_longterm_investment_heres/,4248,1618539756.0,"*⚜️I am NOT a financial advisor and this is NOT financial advice. If you read this post and still YOLO into DOGE, I wish you hella profit. Your success will never affect mine.⚜️*

I’ve seen a lot of members in this sub argue back and forth why Dogecoin is a good investment. 

I’ve even seen a user state “Dogecoin will be #2 soon. People literally don’t understand the value of memes. Humor will never get old nor go out of style”.

Now before the Doge army downvotes me into oblivion, let me explain myself.

Bitcoin has a supply limit. No coins can ever be added above 21 million, so it is considered a good store of value. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is inflationary and has no supply limit. Each minute, 10,000 Doge is added into the network. At this rate, miners add more than 5 billion coins per year.  

Think about that. Each minute, 10,000 DOGE have to be bought just to keep it at the same price. 

Now I know what you might be thinking; Doge is only $0.45, that only equals $4500 per minute! What you do not think about, though, is the fact that this crypto has no utility. Yes, it can be spent, and yes, it is pumped by Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. But other than that, it really isn’t utilized. You know why every person I know is invested into it in the first place? To make money. That’s it. 

To compare, let’s take the US Dollar. This sub knows that the USD has been a much less than optimal store of value over the years. Let’s compare the inflation rates to Dogecoin. 

From 1913-2021, the US Dollar has had an average inflation rate of 3.10%. (Has been MUCH worse since COVID, but that’s besides the point.)

With Dogecoin’s supply addition protocol, the inflation rate over the past years has been 4.68%. Now of course the set amount added is static, so theoretically the inflation rate would decrease over time, but this is still less than optimal. 

I made this post to protect the new ones entering this space and being attempted to throw a substantial amount into DOGE. If your goal is to make a long term investment, look elsewhere.

Now don’t get it twisted; I’ve made money from DOGE too. But it is a short term interest coin and a pump and dump coin - I believe it should be treated as such.

Lastly, this isn’t a comparison to any other coin. I’m just providing a bit of information to those new members who flock to any coin shilled to them. 

I wish you all the best, and please research coins before you throw money into them.

Cheers🐶

*Edit 1: I did this to save people from a risky investment. I didn’t say DOGE was a bad short term investment, just a bad long term investment. If you can ride the hype and make money, why wouldn’t you do that?? I just provided some tokenomics :)*

*Edit 2: Read some of these comments. People have insulted me, insulted my intelligence, said I was just jealous, called me a liar, etc. I’ve also received multiple threats from people both posted on here and sent to me privately. I still wish the best for these people and truly hope they get to a better place mentally, regardless of how much money is at stake...*",2021-04-15 21:22:36

Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you'll be part of some group/society.

Seeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by \~10 years my retirement (I'm in my 60's now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I've always wanted. In \~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.

After 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like ""so... is this it?"". I was not happy anymore. Don't get me wrong: I wasn't *unhappy*, but I wasn't happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? 

Friends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I'd won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife's funeral. 

At the end, I've decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I'm quite happy. I've also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.

So my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what's left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. 

Boredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.

Godspeed to you all!

We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. 

#What's happening now and how bad will it get?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.

Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""January Effect"" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:

1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs

2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year

While this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:

* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)

* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)

* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)

* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down

* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses

* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.

So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.

**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**

If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. 

The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.

**What should long term investors do?**

For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. 

Essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.

#How to construct your portfolio going forward
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.
 

**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). 

There is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but I can outline mine:

**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. 

* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? 

* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

* What current product exists?

* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?



**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** 

I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.

Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.

The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).

If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do

* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. 

* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. 

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

**Think about your portfolio allocation**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. 

For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.

**Think of your ""circle of competence""**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.


#Summing it up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.

Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.

Take care and have fun investing :)

It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.
15. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** It’s just bitcoin wrapped in ethereum to be used in DeFi applications.
17. **Bitcoin SV (BSV)\*:** Bitcoin Scam Variant
18. **EOS (EOS):** another blockchain, aimed at being highly scalable for commercial use. It aims to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace the blockchain technology.
19. **Elrond (EGLD):** Blockchain architecture focused on scalability and high throughput, achieving this by partitioning the chain state and an improved Proof of Stake mechanism
20. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron’s founder is Richard Hendricks. It is also one of the most popular blockchain to build decentralized applications on.
21. **Cosmos (ATOM):** several independent blockchains trying to create an “internet of blockchains”.
22. **NEM (XEM):** instead of controlling just money, you can control stock ownership, contracts, medical records, and stuff like that
23. **Monero (XMR)\*:** if you need drugs
24. **THETA (THETA):** decentralized video delivery network (peer-to-peer streaming). The token performs various governance tasks within the network.
25. **Tezos (XTZ):** another blockchain for smart contracts, but more eco-friendly and overall trying to encompass different advancements introduced by different blockchains in a single protocol.
26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.
34. **Solana (SOL):** another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.
35. **Dai (DAI):** the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.
36. **Huobi Token (HT):** it’s the official token of Huobi (a centralized exchange), providing advantages similar to BNB (Binance’s), for example fees discounts.
37. **SushiSwap (SUSHI):** a clone of UniSwap (so a decentralized exchange), where there’s a token (SUSHI) given as an additional reward for liquidity providers and farmers.
38. **Binance USD (BUSD):** Stablecoin issued by Binance, tied to USD.
39. **FTX Token (FTT):** It’s a token related to FTX, a platform allowing you to trade leveraged tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain. The token allows for lower fees and socialized gains.
40. **Crypto.com Coin (CRO):** the token of Crypto.com public blockchain, that tries to enable transaction worldwide between people and businesses.
41. **Filecoin (FIL):** a decentralized storage system, trying to decentralize cloud storage services.
42. **UMA (UMA):** it builds open-source infrastructure in order to create synthetic tokens on the Ethereum blockchain
43. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):** another token, this time related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex.
44. **BitTorrent (BTT):** BitTorrent is a famous peer-to-peer file sharing platform. It is trying to get more decentralized by introducing its token, which grants you some benefits such as increased download speeds.
45. **Celsius (CEL):** Celsius is one of the first banking platforms for cryptocurrency users, where you can earn interest, borrow cash and make payments/transfers. The CEL token grants you some benefits such as increased payouts.
46. **Algorand (ALGO):** Algorand is a blockchain network aiming to improve scalability and security. ALGO is the native cryptocurrency of the network, used for a borderless economy and to secure stability in the blockchain.
47. **Dash (DASH):** It is a fork of Litecoin launched in 2014, focused on improving the transaction times of the blockchain and become a cheap, decentralized payments network.
48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web.",2021-02-09 14:03:25

Selling all my crypto because of an authoritarian government,14268,ldh53f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ldh53f/selling_all_my_crypto_because_of_an_authoritarian/,1942,1612587600.0,"Hi guys,

I'm from a third world country called India. The right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (They are so tone-deaf they called Bitcoin a [""private cryptocurrency""](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). 

Of course, you can never ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why I am selling my crypto when I could just as easily use a VPN. Well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. In 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [CAA protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. They silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. It's. fucked. up.

Currently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. The government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. 

[When Greta Thunberg and Rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the Ministry of External Affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. The protestors are also dealt with harshly and Delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited all banks in India from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. However, the industry went to the Supreme Court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in March last year. The crypto industry rose in India again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. 

The worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. And you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they ""destroyed it"". [All governments have a history with corruption in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). My exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax ID, and they can easily track me. 

That's why I'm selling everything I have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. I really don't want to sell but I think it's better if I cash out instead of letting the government decide what I should do with my coins or face jail time.

I know India is probably not in your circle of concern right now but Bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. However, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of Rihana and Greta Thunberg. 

I hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again.

Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,14182,n5wkwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5wkwq/will_doge_be_worth_100_a_coin_can_it_become_as/,2939,1620295260.0,"The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let’s look at a few popular ones…

Bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world’s 3rd largest currency. 

Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That’s worth more than all of Walmart. 

So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. 

Let’s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000
coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy…the largest economy in the world?

Let’s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. 

If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.

Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don’t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it’s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. 

Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:

Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion

Chainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion

Cardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. 

ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! 

Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. 

Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. 

MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. 

Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It’s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we’re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. 

Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. 

The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I’d say that’s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. 

(Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)",2021-05-06 05:01:00

I just don't want to see more people falling for trash projects like these so please beware. The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says ""they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more"".

The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. ""I made 100x gains"", ""is it wrong for the little guy to make money"", ""i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins"".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

In addition to this, trading is frequently halted due to volatility as we saw with Dogecoin yesterday which in some cases means you won’t be able to sell on a massive drop, even with a stop loss order in place. 

There is also often a large gap between the current sell price and buy price which should not be happening for coins with decent volume. 

Buying on Robin Hood defeats the whole decentralized point of cryptocurrency which allows you to be in control of your coins. And if if you are coming here from WSB, fuck Robin Hood anyway. Don’t support these slimy market manipulators. 

That being said, market manipulation also exists on any crypto exchange so be aware of pump and dumps, especially when coins instantly shoot up in price with no real rhyme or reason. Be safe out there.

EDIT: Since so many are asking what exchanges to use, personally I would recommend Coinbase or even better Coinbase Pro as the fees are lower. From there you can transfer to Binance (Binance US In the states) or other exchanges if you wish to continue trading. You can also buy directly through Binance although I find their fees to be a bit steep. There are several other options too such as Kraken, Bithumb, Gemini, etc. although Coinbase is probably the easiest to use for beginners.

EDIT 2: To clarify, if you bought on Robinhood you likely aren’t going to lose your investment or anything like that. I just wouldn’t recommend it because it defeats the whole purpose of crypto and technically what they are giving you is an IOU for what the coins are worth based on market value. Technically though you don’t own or control the coins which to me is one of the coolest things about blockchain technology.

EDIT 3: I might get blasted for this one, but if you are new to crypto and just trying to buy Dogecoin, please be careful. As you can see with the huge and steady drop, this is what’s known as a pump and dump which is unfortunately is very common in crypto. I’m not saying you can’t make money by timing your trades, but it’s very difficult to predict and most of the smaller traders will end up losing. If you are planning on buying and holding a coin you may not want to invest in something when it’s already up several hundred percent. Do your own research and don’t just listen to people on the internet telling you what to buy as they are likely bagholders trying to pump the price.",2021-01-29 18:37:25

Don’t get burned with Dogecoin,12270,mt1xzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt1xzi/dont_get_burned_with_dogecoin/,3763,1618732194.0,"Today on r/Dogecoin a user posted a video of himself: he sat in a chair, his head concealed by a pillow case, a black revolver pressed to his temple. He ranted about the lies surrounding Dogecoin and said he planned to kill himself. All I know is that he lived long enough to post the video. It was quickly removed by mods. 

So, before you buy Dogecoin, you should know what you are getting. Here’s a short summary:

Dogecoin has a huge supply. 129 billion coins. 10,000 coins are mined per minute. That’s 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins added every eighty days. 

Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. So, Dogecoin mints more coins every two days than Bitcoin will ever have in circulation. That’s why doge will never be priced like Bitcoin. And, in fact, at about $9 per Dogecoin, Dogecoin would equal Bitcoin in value. 

Dogecoin has no real ecosystem to make it valuable. It is not fast: 33 transactions per second. ETH 2.0 can handle 100,000 per second. So Dogecoin can’t serve as a currency. It seems to have minimum dev work. And it’s fueled by people who think they are getting into doge early. If you buy now, you are not. Dogecoin is not the future of anything. 

With Dogecoin, you are buying hype. 

And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold that value. In fact, at $1 per Dogecoin, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investment every few months JUST TO MAINTAIN $1.00 

Also, be aware that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap. That’s the same value as STARBUCKS. And doge has almost zero use-case scenarios. Sure you can buy some Mavs merch. Maybe find some occasional doge fans that accept it as payment. But doge can’t scale to be a currency. It’s too slow. 

Doge, frankly, is way overpriced right now. And Doge is going to have trouble maintaining it’s value due to its always-expanding supply. If the hype falls off just a bit—doge will fall, too. And twitter’s algorithm is heavily weighted against repeat trends. You might make money with doge, but it is far from guaranteed, and there is a fairly hard ceiling due to doge’s constant supply. 

If you buy doge, you are buying hype and Elon Musk tweet energy and nothing else.

Cashing out tonight because I finally met my goal of buying a house!,11275,miww8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/miww8c/cashing_out_tonight_because_i_finally_met_my_goal/,1306,1617436394.0,"I have been a crypto investor since 2017 but only took it serious over the last year. Up until last July I have always been a McDonald's manager. I was the fix it manager sent into problem stores to change how they operate to make profit targets. I made garbage wages, was treated like garbage, and I felt like garbage.

In 2014 I went back to school to study an engineering technology diploma and then last year went back again to take an advanced diploma in Ocean Technology. I got my dream job making better money. With my first few paychecks I put $100 into Ethereum. I continued until October until I had invested $1500 (Canadian) and I sat on it until now. 

As of tonight between investing in gamestop and my cryptocurrency investments I have enough for a large down-payment on a house and enough for lawyers fees and moving fees. We have placed an offer in on a great house and we close the deal on May 4th. 

I want to thank the cryptocurrency community for keeping me strong when I felt like I was about to lose it all and for also reminding me that taking profits is okay. I believe in Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole and I have no doubt I could make more money. But, I have met my goal and it is time for me to take profits.

**Edit 1 - Thank you everyone for the kind words! I am blown away by the community that exists on this subreddit. This is not the end of my crypto days, it is just a stepping stone.",2021-04-03 02:53:14

**August 19th, 2020:**

We made the video and sent it in. This is in hindsight, a mess up on our part, as he sent the wire from his closed bussiness account, which is now a personal account to him. The assets of the company were sold, but obvisouly the bank account is still his. You don't sell you bank account with a business, that would make no sense since a dollar == a dollar. But this is what we replied with.

>Attached is the video. I'm having trouble with attachment size, as it only allows up to 25mb, so I have to send the bank statement in another email. I had to make the video 720p. I'll also like to add that R\*\*\* Electric Construction Inc was my business but is no longer going since I've retired. Please see next email for the Bank Statement. 

&#x200B;

**August 21st, 2020:**

Didn't hear from them, so we sent another email

>Sorry to reply again. Just trying to think of what it means about the 7 DAYS REFUSED, and the only verification that took a long time was the Advanced Verification, because I only had it half done for a week, I have quite a few emails about it saying failed during that time it wasn’t complete. I eventually finished it and have the email saying it was successful. Then I completed the Fiat Verification as well. I need the reason why it failed and what verification it was, so I know what to do. Does it have anything to do with the wire itself? If I can’t get verified for what ever reason, how do I get my money back? I’d like to just get this done and use your exchange. I’m getting worried, as I have no clue why my account was locked in the first place.

>It has now been a whole month since I have sent you all my information proving that I own the R\*\*\* Electric bank account. It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn’t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn’t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn’t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn’t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn’t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don’t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?

>Don’t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account.

From here, we have nothing but problems trying to do a wire withdrawal. Sent him an email.

> When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can't change it to R\*\*\* Electric. Should I just wire it to my Greenwood Credit Union account instead, or do you think the wire will work with my name?

So we try it, and it's not working, we sent an email to him again.

> I started the wire, but I haven't received the confirmation email from Prime Trust. It's been around 20 minutes, checked my spam and everything. I added [info@primetrust.com](mailto:info@primetrust.com) to my contacts, not sure if that is the email to whitelist or not. Should I try to do another wire withdrawal?

**November 25th:**

Wire isn't working, tried a bunch of things but the confirmation email never gets sent to confirm and start the withdrawal. 

> Hey, I went to the account and under withdrawals it said failed, but like I mentioned I never got the email to confirm it. I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. 

&#x200B;

**November 27th:** 

>Hey Biggs, I’m not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it’s correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I’m not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don’t think your team will ever get it. I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn’t work either. I can’t change the name of the wire to try to send it to the R\*\*\* Electric account, so I’m not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don’t know the legality of that. Let me know, it’s been over that 72hr limit and I’m not sure what to do here.

Stuck in limbo, I tried to so a wire withdrawal 6 times, different banks, and even different account numbers for each bank. Never worked.

**December 6th:**

**THIS IS THE REAL KICKER OF THE WHOLE STORY, GET A LOAD OF THIS SCHEME.**

A little background here. I didn't try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.

Mind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.

**December 6th:**

>Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don't work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it?

I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either.

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",2021-05-05 08:06:58
Are NFTs a potential game changer for unsolicited d*ck pics?,10837,mbmvm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbmvm1/are_nfts_a_potential_game_changer_for_unsolicited/,1093,1616557124.0,"Hear me out...

Let's say you receive an unwanted and poorly composed shot of someone's junk (I'll also assume you're a lady, since they get the vast majority of them).

Don't delete that thing - mint it as an NFT and credit the sender as the original artist. 

Then, send them an invite to buy their art and remove it from the blockchain. If they don't, their name and nads will exist forever more in the very public blockchain, for all to see. 

The best part is there's only like, what, 3.75 billion d*cks on the planet, and if men get discouraged from sending them, they become SCARCE. 

The market cap potential is enormous. I've done some analysis, and predict d*ck pic NFTs could hit $1 million in the next 5 years. 

Now is the time to get involved and start DCA (d*ck, camera, action!) into this exciting new project.

Edit to add for everyone asking how you can prove its that person's dick: it's really simple. You can prove its theirs by getting them to send you another picture of their dick, and checking if they look the same. This is called Proof of Dick.

The upside of this, is that now you have TWO dick pics, so you've basically doubled your money.",2021-03-23 22:38:44

Let’s be honest here, “dumb money” and new retail investors are approaching the crypto world with doge right now, putting there their money and I’m afraid also their life savings. New joiners have no clue of how mean can be volatility, especially on a coin like this. They don’t know what to do, they don’t have an exit strategy. They just see green, +200% and your tweets. They are gonna lose money, blame crypto and flag it as a scam. Once again. Please, know what you are doing.

20% dip? 🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me.,10380,lqqc1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqqc1q/20_dip_looks_pretty_normal_to_me/,726,1614136237.0,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year.

I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,10066,moilxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/moilxv/im_been_in_crypto_since_2013_maybe_700_alt_coins/,1310,1618137468.0,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more.",2021-04-11 05:37:48

You guys asked for it so here it is: I built a bot that buys Bitcoin when Elon Musk Tweets about it and open sourced it,9776,mflmpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mflmpo/you_guys_asked_for_it_so_here_it_is_i_built_a_bot/,767,1617038794.0,"In my last post, you guys were interested in my bot project that buys Bitcoin when Elon tweets about it so here it is!

The bot was initially designed to buy Bitcoin when Elon Musk tweets about, regardless of the sentiment of the tweet. I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: ""Bitcoin is too high imo"" and the bot buys at the wrong time.

So I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.

I have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)

The bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account! But if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account, here you go:

EXPLANATION: The recent crash was probably due to margin accounts having a cascading crash on Binance.,8682,mt5odv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt5odv/explanation_the_recent_crash_was_probably_due_to/,2005,1618747155.0,"Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.

But when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.

So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.

This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.

The bad news is the price is lower, but there's a silver lining. The good news is the market is in a healthier position after this. Most of the unsustainable degenerate margin accounts are probably gone. If we go up to $60k in the next week, it's not because of borrowing (as much). Going forward, at least for the near term, another event like this is not very likely.

The price we see right now could be thought of as being closer to the ""real"" price which we would have had without the degenerates.

TLDR: Fuck Binance

And fuck the rest of the exchanges with 150x leverage bullshit

EDIT: Some people wanted more evidence to support this theory, so I suggest you look at the price differences between the exchanges (Binance vs. Coinbase, for instance) during the crash. You'll notice the exchange with leverage was significantly lower in price, which suggests bots were arbitraging Coinbase down to match it. Additionally, note the Tether price during the crash, which went up to $1.05.

1. His kids were not interested in stocks but are hooked onto cryptocurrencies, and the government has to respect that, and develop a positive outlook.  

2. While scams and fraudsters must be cracked down, the general market must be allowed to develop. A working group of SEC, FINCEN, CFTC and other group members are working on identifying scams in this space.

3. When asked if Crypto has any ""intrinsic value""? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it. 

4. Price of Bitcoin is just one publicly traded company like McDonalds. In comparison, global money supply is 7.6T. And since Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, value of all gold in the world is 8T.


5. HOLY SHT.. He just mentioned ""HODL"". Hahaha - According to him its ""Hold on for dear life"". 

""We must crack down hard on those who abuse our young enthusiasm for bitcoin and blockchain technology""

""We owe it to this new generation, to respect their interest in this new technology with a thoughtful regulatory approach.""

Though the SEC chair addressed that there was not much they could do, but are working with Feds and the treasury. 

- ""illegal transactions"" was discussed, and the steps taken to combat misuse of crypto.

It got to the frontpage with about 8k upvotes. If you read the article you will see that:

&#x200B;

1. It's from March 12, not recent.
2. Any ""proposed bill"" needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn't ""passed"".
3. It's already dead on the Senate [as you can read here: ""Status: Engrossed on March 8 2021 - 50% progression, **died in chamber**](https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB681/2021)""
4. The proposed bill intended to add a **16 point Financial Literacy course** to 10th and 11th graders **where one of them was cryptocurrency** [as you can see here.](https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/199139)
5. This is literally in the second paragraph of the original article: *According to the report, the bill aims to amend the current curriculum for 10th and 11th-grade students. The new program would consist of 16 new areas of financial literacy such as cryptocurrency, balancing a checking account, money management, making investments, and completing loan applications, among other traditional subjects.*

&#x200B;

Easy conclusion: Georgia is not teaching students about Crytocurrency. People will upvote whatever makes them feel good even though a simple reading of the article and a small amount of critical thinking would make them at least question the way the headline was written.

Real world Nano adoption by McDonald's!,7661,m7m7om,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m7m7om/real_world_nano_adoption_by_mcdonalds/,727,1616084323.0,"I just managed to get an extra large Big Mac meal at McDonald's without having to spend any Fiat!!

When going to pay at the counter, the cashier asked card or cash? I responded by saying that I can pay with Nano which is fast and feeless, arriving in their wallet in under 1 second.

She looked a little funny at me and said they only accept Visa or Mastercard. I responded by saying that this isn't dirty centralised fiat money which is being hyperinflated to nothing by ""money printers going brrrrr"" (I made hand signals to emphasise how fast the printing is).

At this point she looked really scared but I think that's because she understood the reality how badly the dollar value is being inflated.

She called her manager to presumably explain this amazing opportunity, whilst I pulled out a map of some Nano faucets we could go to and test out how amazing Nano is.

The manager said I can take the meal if I promise to leave immediately. I'm assuming it's because he was so excited to close up and start adopting Nano.

I can't believe it, not only is Nano fast and feeless but it also gets you free things!!! This is real world adoption and I can't wait to get every single McDonald's on the Nano train.

A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets,7625,lkkm0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lkkm0v/a_beginners_guide_to_cryptocurrency_wallets/,1004,1613444983.0,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

I proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!

**Features:**

- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data. I can add more, if required.
- Quickly see impact of different market caps using a slider, as well as input a hypothetical amount of coins to calculate total worth.
- Supports multiple reference fiat currencies (USD,JPY,GBP,CHF,CAD,AUD,HKD,CNY)
- Coin data is auto-refreshed every 3 hours, including Fiat exchange rates
- Mobile friendly
- No ads, no spam (LPT: use uBlock Origin if you don't already)

I'm still tweaking the UI -- if you have suggestions let me know.

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback!
- Now supports Dark Mode (will default to your OS preference)
- Now supports manual input
- WIP: advanced view, where you can specify all the parameters!


Hope this helps someone.

Take some deep breaths, nice and slow. Put your hands on something solid... Your desk or table or something like that.

Be right here for a minute. Just focus on your breathing.

I know things are a lot right now and this dip is scary, but also right now you're ok. Walk away from the charts for a while, enjoy your friends/family/pets and come back after a while. This shit happens all the time in crypto and we are still solidly in the midst of a bullrun. Give the whales time to shake out weak hands in order to scoop up more on discount. If you can buy the dip, if you can't buy the dip just hold and you'll be ok if you just have patience.

If you're panicking right now, maybe reconsider how much you have invested or what coins your invested in. This is a volitile space and your mental health is more important than some quick gains.

How a became a millionaire using crypto technical analysis and here is a guide,7322,lhia2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lhia2b/how_a_became_a_millionaire_using_crypto_technical/,574,1613069385.0,"I wanna share how i became a millionaire using technical analysis and maybe you can do it to.

Technical analysis is the study of statistical trends, collected from historical price and volume data, to identify opportunities for trade. Technical analysts observe patterns of price movements, trading signal and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength and weakness of an asset.  

Technical Analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data such as cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and stocks.

A chart of prices and volume represents all the past decisions taken by market participants (buying and selling). This information will, in turn, affect future participant decisions in two ways:

* **Psychological**: What you did in the past affects how you approach future situations. For example, many traders tend to focus on the price at which they bought an asset, and if it declines, they want to sell when it reaches break-even again.
* **Reflexive**: Some traders identify trends and chart patterns which are common, and act accordingly (buying or selling). If a sufficient number of participants follow the same strategy, it is expected that these chart patterns will follow the expected outcome and that the trend will likely to be sustained by more and more participants joining the trend.

**Bollinger Bands**

Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope) with a simple moving average in the middle. The width of the envelope expresses the volatility.

Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset can increase or decrease. A higher volatility means that the asset can potentially **fluctuate rapidly within a larger range of value**.

**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (or MACD) is a trend following indicator that looks at the combination of two moving averages:

* A short-term moving average
* A long-term moving average  


These two moving averages are combined to identify what is the current trend and if there is a change in the momentum.  


The MACD lines displayed below can be interpreted as follows:  


* If the blue line (MACD line) is above the orange line (Signal line), the momentum is bullish.
* On the contrary, if the blue line is below the orange line, the momentum is bearish.
* When the lines diverge, it denotes a strengthening of the current trend while a convergence shows a trend reversal.
* When the lines cross, it is likely that the change in momentum is confirmed.

"Ethereum: I performed 3 types of analysis that show ETH can reach ~8k this cycle (not 10k, 15k, 20k)",7014,muiu5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/muiu5x/ethereum_i_performed_3_types_of_analysis_that/,1150,1618922606.0,"**Update 4/20:** WOW, I woke up to over 5,000 likes, I seriously didn't expect all this love! Thank you all so very much, it truly means a lot!! I posted a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myc_KexWcrY) as well for anyone interested.

# Summary

Hi all, it's your friendly data science guy! There are many opinions on how high ETH can reach this cycle, so I looked at the data to get a better answer.

**In 2017:**

* **ETH Dominance** (ETH/Total Crypto Cap) ranged from 9% to 18% (peak) to 30% (July 2017)
* **ETH/BTC** ranged from 0.007 to 0.1 (peak) to 0.15 (June 2017)
* **ETH** was overvalued by \~4096% in 2018 peak relative to logarithmic regression

**In 2021**

* **ETH Dominance** (ETH/Total Crypto Cap) held at 7%
* **ETH/BTC** held at 0.016

**Takeaways**

* If we look at ETH Dominance and ETH/BTC tables below, the average of the likely scenarios in red box are in the **upper 8k range**
   * The total crypto market cap went up by 55x from 2013 peak (15B) to 2017 peak (830B)
   * In 2021, it is certainly not impossible for crypto market cap to go up 5-10x from 2017 peak
* ETH will likely hit a resistance at 1T market cap. Given that this market cycle is faster than last cycle, its possible that we will peak out sooner in \~Aug/Sep. ETH at 1T market cap (adjusted for increased supply) in Aug is  **8,511**
* If we look at ETH Log regression in August and apply a similar over-valuation, it puts ETH at **7,805**
* The most likely outcome is that **ETH will reach \~8k this cycle** and any higher is statistically unlikely.

I'm Truly Disappointed.,7009,7n3fxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n3fxk/im_truly_disappointed/,361,1514690443.0,"Guys. We need to talk:

This subreddit above all else is supposed to be a hub of news, useful discourse, information, and understanding of cryptocurrencies/crypto assets in general. Through it I've found some amazing coins and made investments that I would have never known to make.

But that's only because I didn't listen to the trash level sentiment being carried out and the hardcore tribalism that causes people to lose out on good, solid investments. So here, lemme break this into 3 categories:

**FOR THE INVESTORS**

It has become incredibly clear to me that FAR too large of a portion of our reader base on this sub is entirely unaware of the fundamentals of investing in new tech. This is not a sports team, this is not some TV show or fad, THIS IS A BRAND FUCKING NEW ASSET CLASS THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR SOCIETY. And it is MUCH too early to be acting like we've already made our correct bets and that nothing can happen to change the trajectory of our favorite project.

1) How is the TECH/Whitepaper? (this should always be your FIRST question)

2) How is the Dev Team?

3) Do they have a funding scheme? What kind? (community donation, venture capital, institutional investment/buyouts, ICO etc.)

4) How are they organized?

5) How is their track record?

6) Do they have any institutional or prolific backing?

7) Does it solve a goddamn problem or alleviate friction anywhere?

8) Does it have competition and where does it stand within that?

9) How close to ready is it?

10) Any plans to create, stimulate, and maintain adoption?

11) Does it have a Marketing and media presence? A good one?

12) How is its Mainstream visibility?

13) How about Accesibility and Liquidity?

14) Growth potential based on current price and supply

15) Can it survive or at least get around the regulatory hammer?

Regardless of what you think your coin's shit smells like, these are the things you need to know in order to decide where the hell you're putting your money. Because each and every single one of these questions is important in determining the value potential and sustainability of your coin. If you actually care about making money then you'll shed your need to be on a single team and diversify your assets based on the fundamentals. Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**

In general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.

Think about that.

If I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:

NEO: 1150% Gains as of now
ICX: 5080% Gains as of now
XRP: 1720% Gains as of now

^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?

**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**

For people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

If you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.

I'm done.",2017-12-30 21:20:43
"The Bitgrail hack was months ago, bomber defrauded new users of their assets to pay off old users. This is a criminal act. We need to contact the EU/Italian authorities & make sure he's punished.",6947,7wlo19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7wlo19/the_bitgrail_hack_was_months_ago_bomber_defrauded/,881,1518301196.0,"Let's be clear here Francesco Firano (/u/TheBomber9) is a criminal. The hack was in November which means that he's been insolvent for months & has been defrauding new users out of their money to keep the exchange afloat. Once the Binance listing was imminent he locked all the exchange's assets. His actions show clear intent. If his exchange was hacked & he immediately reported it to the police, he'd just be incompetent but by hiding this from new users he transitioned from moron to criminal. 

This is the US legal definition of Fraud:

* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.

[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)

>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: 

> * (1) a false statement of a material fact,

>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, 

>* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, 

>* (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and 

>* (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.

Now I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)

We need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. 

I'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims. I don't trust him at all when he said he has reported this to authorities, it's **very likely he completely misrepresented the situation to them** even if he did (which is also a crime).

If you live in the USA & are a victim please call the FBI to file a report. Apparently extradition is possible between the USA & Italy. If there is enough outcry about this situation maybe we can get the wheels turning.

Edit: [He's also guilty of embezzlement](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement )

> Elements common to embezzlement are as follows: (1) the property must belong to a person other than the accused, such as an employer or principal; (2) the property must be converted subsequent to the defendant's original and lawful possession of it; (3) the defendant must be in a position of trust, so that the property is held by him or her pursuant to some fiduciary duty; and (4) the defendant must have an intent to defraud the owner at the time of the conversion.

Edit: Evidence he knew about the hack (personally I think it's borderline impossible for him not to realize he's missing over 3/4ths of the XRB in his wallet but here's some hard evidence anyways).

Then the same with XRP. I had friends calling me about it and asking advice and I told them exactly what I thought was going on, which transpired to be the case.  Lucky they took my advice and held off.

I can't help but think in which mindset are students who lately made some quick gains. If you did take some gains, I can only congratulate you, you probably did better than most of your student peers who are probably not fully aware of what crypto is.

But be aware that once you make your first gains, there is something I call the ""casino effect"". It pushes you to take more and more risks. I think it can be even amplified as a student because most of you don't have yet a monthly income. I remember that each penny counts and insane gains can start turning your head. At the same time, you are in the period of your life when you need to make very important decisions.

Lately, you might read about young Samsung employees quitting their jobs in South Korea thanks to millions of $ they earned in crypto. Or read cool posts about huge gains and lambo.
And you might think there is no good reason to study anymore.
Strangely there is not much about people ashamed of massive losses.

My message is for you to keep in mind you must measure your risk. Crypto is great but who knows when the rollercoaster ends or when you will make bad moves (we all do). You can not rely only on that. Hopefully the recent dip made you realize that. Please treat your study as your top priority and crypto as a bonus. If you make it in crypto, that would be amazing. If not, you still have a diploma and a good option in life.

- Crypto = great
- Crypto + job = better

Don't gamble on your life. Don't have regrets. Decision is only yours.

Youtubers are constantly saying “this is just FUD”, and “the Bull market is not over”, and “Buy the dip”. But the problem is that A LOT of the FUD that newcomers feel, actually come from the crappy Youtubers, with their shitty “😱😱🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕📈📈📉📉” thumbnails.

Imagine you finally bought some Bitcoin, maybe you bought it at 60k, and you see the market going 10% down. You invested in crypto, and it’s your first experience with volatility.

You go to YouTube, and your homepage is now flooded with “THE MARKET IS TANKING 😱😱😱😱😱💥💥💥” “BITCOIN BEAR MARKET”.

How do you think this would make you feel if you just came to the cryptocurrency market? I personally would feel a lot of fear, and try to cut my losses, as I wouldn’t know what any of this meant. Now I take a loss, and the market starts going up, and then I buy...and the cycle continues. It’s the meme of buy high, sell low...but although it is a joke, it does happen to a lot of people.

We need to help the people that feel this way, by giving them reassurance. By not letting their emotions take over. I try to do this on the daily discussion, and maybe if you read this far, you could also jump in sometimes.

"When every crash is a ""dip"" and every bounce is a ""we have liftoff"" -- that's how a frog gets boiled to death. 2017 Crumbs of Wisdom thread for Bull Runs.",6305,m2lky8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m2lky8/when_every_crash_is_a_dip_and_every_bounce_is_a/,1234,1615480293.0,"Like many of you, I got burned by hodling too long through 2017/2018. ""Hodl"" is a stupid meme for newbs. I learned the hard way.

So called ""fundamentals"" ('solid team', 'awesome project', 'upcoming partnerships')  don't reflect the price in a company that received its funding before it has ever proven anything (that's the primary difference between an ICO and an IPO). ***Where my REQ marines at?***

When this bull run is actually over (and personally i don't believe that it is yet), you probably won't come to accept it until your portfolio is sitting at 50% of its ATH and your ""stack"" of crypto has become a ""bag"" you're stuck holding ""until you reach XX number again--then you'll sell *for sure*.""

Here's the reality: Once the bubble pops, every crash is going to seem like a ""dip"" and every ""bounce"" is going feel like a ""this is gentlemen.""  ***That's how frogs get boiled to death.***

Here are some principles you need to keep in mind if you want to walk away from this bull run with a fat stack of cash:

1. Recognize and accept that you won't sell the exact top, and that--subsequently--your portfolio's ""true value"" is only what you sell it for--not what it's ATH was at one point.
2. Pick a realistic sum (take your dream figure and subtract 50%) at which you're going to cash out a certain percentage--or all of it--and (here's the important part): ***STICK TO IT.***
   1. This latter point is most crucial, because as the sum grows and actually hits that number you picked, you're going to be very tempted to leave it in ""just a little longer"". That's greed talking. If you ask Greed ""how much is enough?"" the answer is always ""a little bit more."" Have discipline in this and you'll win. Let greed take over and you'll lose. *If you let greed govern your decisions in a bull market, then you'll let panic govern your decisions in a bear market.*
3. You can't predict the future--so don't judge your past self for knowledge you have today. ""Why didn't i buy that coin?!?! it just mooned!"" Or ""Why didn't i sell before it crashed?!"" You know what happened yesterday because it's today--you can't get mad at yourself for not possessing today's knowledge on the day before yesterday.
4. My final and **MOST IMPORTANT** point:
   1. As I said before ***your portfolio is only worth what you actually sell it for***. So do **NOT** focus on ***how much it was*** or ***how much it could have been*** \-- if you make this mistake you will be dissatisfied at turning $1000 into $100,000. If you've only got a $1,000 right now, you're probably thinking ""of course i'd be happy with $100k!"" -- but when you get there you'll be holding out for 200/300/1 million. In your greed, you won't be satisfied with an enormous return--especially if you keep thinking about how you could have had $1,000,000 if you just ""bought that dip"" that no one saw coming or ""held xyz coin"" a little bit longer.  ***Focus on what you have today--not what you might have tomorrow.***

Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ≈ $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you’ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They’re all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

&#x200B;

Investing in Crypto with Low Income: How I've been doing it,6155,m983wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m983wv/investing_in_crypto_with_low_income_how_ive_been/,686,1616279280.0,"I'm from a 3rd world country with a very unstable economy and hyper inflated currency. I got into cryptocurrency at the beginning of COVID because I lost my job and there were no other jobs available, so I did some research and saw how fiat and will of governments are the major reason my people suffer this much and also how crypto can help bypass these restrictions.

So, after doing research and calculating electricity costs and gains, I invested most of my savings into a small mining rig which ended up earning me more money per month than my previous job because the price of ETH got better. For reference I was making 110$ per month from my job, but I was earning roughly 160$ from mining every month. I found another job recently, but for quite some time, mining was my primary source of income. Now I roughly earn 300$ per month, mining + my job.

Anyway the reason I brought this up was to show how little I was earning and how I still managed to invest in crypto. Usually investing requires a large amount of initial capital (Such as stocks and property), which many people don't have, but crypto doesn't have any such barrier. I started spending less and less on things I didn't really need. Smoking, drinking, occasional drug use (marijuana) and ordering food all the time. These can be anything, for me it was these things. Some people spend excessive money on collectible, games, clothing etc... So its up to each individual to find out what is their needless spending.

I quit smoking, drugs and alcohol and started cooking more. This allowed me to invest around 1$ per day in BTC or coin of my choice. Sometimes I simply held onto my ETH instead of selling it, and sometimes I bought another coin. But as I said, it was around 30$ a month. It's basically nothing in terms of international value, but it was decent amount of money for me (inflation is a bitch) and now depending on the coin I invested in, I have profits in almost all of them. Even though I convert most of my mining into fiat to spend on bills and costs of living, every investment I made I've been hodling ever since. It didn't make me rich or anything, but now I have basically tripled my investments and have more in savings than I ever did.

Which one are you more likely to regret more:

1. I could have spent the whole year smoking and drinking, and eating bad food, but I didn't
2. I could have spent the whole year investing in crypto and living a healthier life, but I didn't

In fact, with my savings, I would feel less terrible for indulging in things I quit now and then, because its no longer a big economic drain like it used to be and we are all human, so we do deserve some leisure spending. Its all thanks to that crucial year of investing.

I recommend everyone to do their own research, but I still believe it's early enough to invest a small amount of your income in crypto every month, hodl and see profits long term. My mother thinks I am some kind of genius for tripling our savings, but she simply doesn't understand the concept of crypto. In reality, I was just following crypto info on my 2nd monitor while gaming and not spending money on things I didn't need. I am no genius. Crypto simply provides investment opportunities to people who don't have large initial capital to invest in traditional investment avenues.

I hope this has been helpful to other people with low income, specially others who are also from countries that have unstable economy and inflated currencies. Even 1%-5% of your monthly income in crypto is a good long term investment, but as always do your own research and pick your coins. I didn't do ""day trading"" or try to invest in new coins, hoping they would go up. I mainly invested in coins that were solid already. I would suggest the same for fellow low income investors. In the end this has been my experience, and I thought I should share it. And don't forget, this is just for one year. The more we hold, the better. Finally, even if we don't make it, we have merely sacrificed unnecessary things in our lives, we still have the friends and connections we made along the way.

P.S: Happy new year and Nowruz to everyone who follow Iranian/Zoroastrian solar calendar around the world! The equinox is upon us and spring has sprung! Happy first day of spring.

Want to start fresh after the crypto crash? Here is a comprehensive guide on how to invest and prosper over the long term.,6083,7uzrta,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7uzrta/want_to_start_fresh_after_the_crypto_crash_here/,630,1517699019.0,"Well its happened, the crypto market just experienced the worst crash since 2014, the bubble has burst. [The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? 

In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. 

The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the ""irrational exhuberance"" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.

But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.

So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:

#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:

1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.

2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.

3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.

4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.

5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. 

First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.

**ROI targets**

A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. 

But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. 

You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.

**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**

Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion

Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%

This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.

**Risk Management**

Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:

* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. 

The general starting point I would recommend is: 

* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience

* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions

* Don't go all in on speculative picks.

Some more core principles on risk management to consider:

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. 

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.


You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.


**Portfolio Allocation**

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc

* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc

Think about your [""Circle of Competence""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. 

You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)
------------------------------------------

Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:

# Step 1: Filtering and Research

There is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.

[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the ""Enterprise"" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.

Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:

* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. 

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.

* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?

* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How ""shilly"" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?

* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.

You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:

* allocations that give way too much to the founder

* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)

* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords

* vague timelines and no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on 

#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist

Once you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:

Crypto Analysis Checklist |
---------|
What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |
What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |
How big is the market they're targeting? |
Who is their competition and what does it do better? |
What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |
What current product exists? |
How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |
Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |
Can it be easily copied? |
What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |

The last question is the most important. 

This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:

Benefits of Cryptocurrency |
---------|
Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |
Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |
Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |
Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |
Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |
Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |
Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |
Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |


#Step 3: Create a valuation model

You don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**

This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:

1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring
2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability

Combining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.


**Metcalfe's Law**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:

For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47
Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03

Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.

**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**

Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

**More complex valuation models**

If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). 

You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.

Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.

The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.


#Summing it up
------------------------------------------

The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these.

I was awarded 80k reddit moons earlier this year which I sold on the rinkeby testnet using XDai and honeyswap and immediately bought BTC with it. (0.92 BTC to be exact). 

That BTC is now worth $23,736 at a price of $25,800 per BTC.

I have literally made $24k from memes and shitposting.

Thank you reddit, thank you to the crypto community. 

Although it doesnt make up for all the BTC I lost since 2017, it still brightens my day and I will hodl this BTC until the end of time.

I love you all.

Edit: for those who are skeptical, I unloaded on September 26, when the price was hovering between 8-13 cents. I sold 500 at a time over about a 24 hour period. I got >9100 dai total for my 80k moons and traded it for 0.92 BTC

Edit 2: $25,576 at a price of $27,800 16 hours after making this post.

Edit 3: For those needing solid proof, i was posting on 4chan as I sold them. The thread https://warosu.org/biz/thread/22847095 shows some screenshots of my haul as I was selling.",2020-12-26 19:10:42

All it did was further confirm that using their exchange is a terrible idea, especially after the GME fiasco

I started out buying OMG and ANT (before it became NEO) back in 2017.  Those were the days!  The summer of 2017 was popping and thanks to my gains, I went from eating ramen straight out of the pack to using boiled water to soften the noodles.  Before my 2017 gains, my wife's boyfriend gained a lot of respect for me, and he even called me ""brah"" one day as he was picking up my wife for a hot date.  Man, I was on top of the world!

Fast forward to 2018, all my gains was gone.  Poof.  Overnight, I was back to eating ramen straight out of the pack.  I couldn't even afford the flavored ramen, just plain dry ramen with a generic label.  No brand names for me.  My wife's boyfriend went back to calling me Skid Mark instead of Regular Mark, and he never said ""brah"" to me ever again.  I was a loser.

The bear market was rough.  The crypto winter seemed like it would never end.  But I was diamond hands!  I hodled my coins and waited patiently.  Then, it happened!  The crypto winter was over and the bulls were back!  Life handed me a second chance!  My wife's boyfriend is back to calling me Regular Mark, and I think he's gonna call me ""brah"" again one day.  I can't believe how lucky I am!

To celebrate, I bought a pack of hot dogs and put hot dog slices in my ramen!  I still buy the non-flavored ramen cuz I want to save up and one day own a whole Satoshi.  But I believe in my dream!  And now my ramen tastes like boiled hot dog water, and I'm happier than I've ever been!

It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05€ for 50€. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180€. So my total wallet was now €230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. 

Luckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less € if it continues to drop. 

So I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other ""cheap"" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another €500 into my wallet. I put €300 into VET and 350€ into ADA. I might put the remaining €80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. 

I'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out. Doge might not be the most popular among the altcoins  in this sub, but it was a great starting point for me and made me interested in other crypto currencies.  I also want to thank this community for being insightful, helpful and welcoming to crypto newbies.",2021-04-21 19:53:49

You might’ve seen several posts explaining why keeping your coins in a wallet is the best way to hodl. This is true, if you have a significant amounts of a particular coin because then you will be able to cover the expenses of transfer fees which vary from coin to coin.

But with the rise of newcomers, not everyone can afford to buy large numbers of coins. And while you might be tempted to take your coins off an exchange, think about the amount you will spend for fees. For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. 

Another point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure. So don’t worry about your coins being in danger.

If someone has any other suggestions please let us know.

Edit: Tips from comments:

1. From u/ACShreds - Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month so if you do want to withdraw coins, try buying from that platform although the fees are a little high compared to other platforms.

2. From u/thegooddocgonzo - Although exchanges aren’t fully safe, many big and reputable one like Coinbase and Binance will do everything to keep your coins safe because they don’t want any bad reputation. The user also notes that Binance was hacked in 2019 and Binance made sure that no customer was impacted. Stay cautious of smaller and unknown exchanges.

These days you're probably stupid not to have money invested in crypto, but just keep in mind that it's almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. **Everybody is a genius investor in a bull market**. The people you see posting here acting like seasoned investing gurus, are more often than not people who just happened to get lucky a few times. Have fun with your Baron Rothschild memes, acting like every person who invests in crypto is going to become a millionaire. 

This is not the first time in history when a generation of young people have jumped on a wild speculation train and gotten rich. During the height of the dotcom bubble, people had the exact same attitudes. ""25% returns in a year? Those are scrub numbers. Anything less than 100% is unacceptable!"" We all know how that ride ended, and this ride shall too come to an end. Whether it ends in a major bust, or it becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street, this ride will come to an end. Enjoy the great returns while you can.

"In December NFL offensive tackle, Russell Okung, asked for half of his salary in BTC. That half is now worth more than his entire salary.",5424,miskiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/miskiv/in_december_nfl_offensive_tackle_russell_okung/,387,1617423219.0,"Okung asked for half of his $13 million contract for 2020 to be paid in Bitcoin, and the Carolina Panthers were able to make it happen. Here’s some quotes from the article. Sauce at the bottom. 

“If we are looking at where Bitcoin is at now, Okung could be considered one of the highest salaried NFL players at this moment.”

“For instance, when BTC hit $44k, the half of his contract that is paid in BTC climbed to $10.59 million, at $56k+ his half turned into more than his entire quoted salary. As far as 2020 NFL salary stats are concerned, Okung has entered the top five position. However, the NFL has recently decided to cap the league’s salaries at $180 million and a ball player’s contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers’ offensive tackle (OT) gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest-paid OTs.”

“Money is more than currency; it’s power,” said Okung in a statement. “The way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in bitcoin is the first step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.”

“Okung went further into that statement adding: ‘When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create … In a post-fiat world, you won’t have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.”

"If you think banks/credit companies are banning crypto purchases to protect their customers, I have a bridge to sell you.",5402,7v1m8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7v1m8d/if_you_think_bankscredit_companies_are_banning/,762,1517716308.0,"I'm legitimately blown away how many people I see defending the banks/credit companies banning crypto purchases as some type of attempt to protect their customers from a volatile market. Credit is predatory by nature. The bank doesn't care when you max your card out on alcohol, designer clothes, gambling, or any other worthless and risky commodity. Your bank doesn't give one single tiny little shit about you in any way beyond your capacity to generate revenue. You are a revenue generating unit and nothing more, end of story. They are building artificial barriers to crypto because they view it as a direct and fundamental threat to their industries... and with good reason, because it is. The reality is anyone who invests wisely in crypto right now is going to make a significant ROI over the next few years, opening up the opportunity to pay off large balances, which decreases the revenue they earn from interest. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt at self preservation. 

Again I would encourage anyone who has their bank or credit card company create a barrier for them to purchase crypto, to immediately end doing business with that institution and make sure they know why. If my bank halts my purchases, I'll liquidate my account and close it the same day. Same goes with my credit cards, they will get cut up and never used again. DON'T bend over for them.

PSA: Binance recently increased ADA withdrawal fees by 400% and are lying about why they did it,5358,lh39ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lh39ss/psa_binance_recently_increased_ada_withdrawal/,925,1613018419.0,"FINAL EDIT: it's back to 1 ADA 😄

Withdrawing ADA on Binance, until 2 days ago, would ""only"" cost 1 ADA.

They increased it to 3 ADA yesterday, and some time between yesterday and today they increased it further to 5 ADA.

That's a 400% increase in less than 48h. For comparison, transaction fees on Cardano are only 0.17 ADA.

And yet, after a user from r/cardano enquired about this issue, Binance claimed that the 5 ADA fee ""depends on the blockchain and miners"" (Miners on Cardano? Am I missing something?).

Proof: https://ibb.co/5k0MMpq

This is disgusting.

They're promoting their BNB coin boasting about their low fees, making other coins like ADA look like much less appealing alternatives.

When you're in the middle of a bull market and prices continue to rise, it's easy to think that other, more traditional methods of income are a waste of time. Your salary suddenly seems inconsequential and other investments are boring as hell.

We often talk about not putting all your money into crypto, but there's another element to this too - you shouldn't dedicate all your mental energy to crypto either.

When the next bear market comes, and it will come at some point, having nothing in your life except crypto and your portfolio app is going to make for a very depressing period.

Even if you're making paper profits of 10k a day, you still need to develop other areas of your life - whether that's career, relationships, new business ventures etc - because everyone needs something to fall back on, both financially AND mentally.

I run a small SaaS platform in my spare time, and it generates very little money in the grand scheme of things. But it's mine and I enjoy developing it and getting new customers. If the crypto market was to tank tomorrow, I'd still have this, and that would mean a lot to me. 

Equally, I also have my normal job, and whilst it can be a bit dull at times (and in recent months almost a bit pointless!) it is still something I have continued to strive at, and it's another form of personal development that can open future financial doors.

I avoided shady websites, apps that I didn't try personally, and those services that make you download shitty games and malwares. This list contains only trusted services, without any referral codes.

If you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!

&#x200B;

**Coinbase Earn** **\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. 

Once you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.

Right now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.

[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

&#x200B;

**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Basically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). 

The payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.

[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)

&#x200B;

**Faucets \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.

They're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.

There are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google ""<name of the coin> + faucet"".

A [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)

&#x200B;

**Airdrops \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. 

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.

Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.

&#x200B;

**Bounties \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for “bounties”. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. 

As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.

&#x200B;

**WeNano \[NANO\]:**

This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.

Have you ever played Pokémon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pokémon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.

[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)

&#x200B;

**NanoQuakeJs \[NANO\]:**

Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.

[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!

There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.

&#x200B;

**Reddit \[MOON, DOGE, NANO\]:**

Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.

First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!

Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. 

Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.

&#x200B;

**Publish0x \[ETH\]:**

This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.

The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).

[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)

&#x200B;

**SteemIt \[STEEM\]:**

Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.  

It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link

[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.

&#x200B;

**NFT marketplaces \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. 

You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can ""link"" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.

[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. 

&#x200B;

**Games and Collectibles \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.

Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!

Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).

Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)

&#x200B;

Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.

Some I forgot or didn't know about:

* **ethtrader and fortniteBR**: they're also subreddits with a governance tokens (like moons), so you can earn some money shitposting there too.",2021-02-17 18:44:23

**Popular Channels to Avoid Tier:**

[~~Ivan on Tech~~](https://youtube.com/c/IvanonTech) The guy who brought us ""[Respect da pump](https://youtu.be/4TlaEZt6YmQ)"": meme, but his content is terrible

[~~BitBoyCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/channel/UCjemQfjaXAzA-95RKoy9n_g): It's rumored that he dumps his coins on his followers, he promotes risky leverage and his channel content is average at best.

[~~MMCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/c/MMCryptoTube): Same as Bitboy, just empty sensationalism to lure new comers to click on his Bybit affiliate links.

[~~The Moon~~](https://youtube.com/c/TheMoonCarl): His favorite phrase is ""Exaaqctly as predicted"" He buys fake comments to pretend they are making money with his calls so can get more Bybit referrals

**C, D, E, F, Z Tiers / Red Flags**

As a general rule if someone makes stupid faces in the thumbnails, 100x claims, promotes leveraged trading or Bybit links, you should stay away from him

"As an Iranian, Crypto has changed the life of Iranians for good. Especially during COVID-19",4985,ly79uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ly79uw/as_an_iranian_crypto_has_changed_the_life_of/,507,1614960721.0,"Seeing the post about Iran officially considering mining Bitcoin, I felt motivated to make this post as an Iranian. Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)

But things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes mining insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.

There are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to mine currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the ""broker"" to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form mining communities where they work together to discreetly mine and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.

So, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.

The usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective, I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from mining that I do practicing law. I am still working, but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.

I am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.

"Sell walls: What they are, what they do, and how to spot them.",4894,7nqts3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7nqts3/sell_walls_what_they_are_what_they_do_and_how_to/,445,1514968466.0,"Browsing reddit, see a lot of people asking what sell walls are, and an equal number of people giving a poor explanation of their actual purpose. I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.

#What is a sell wall?

A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.

A sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png

###How does it work?

This is best explained as an example.

A wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:

* The stock has a lot of room to grow
* The stock can be easily manipulated
* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future

Richard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* 


To achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:

1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! 

2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.

3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. 

What also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.

Richard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!

##How can you use this to your advantage?

A common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that ""Oh no everyone is selling!!"" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.

As Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*

For a real life example:

VECHAIN. 

For those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). 

What happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.

Such as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png

VECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.

That's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?

What about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. 

Look for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. 

Perhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. 

Once you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.


Hope this helps guys.

Let’s start with reddit and MOONS. I know at the moment even though the amount of moons per karma has decreased incredibly it’s still such an amazing concept to get your head around. Rewarding the user with tokens that could potentially earn the users money just for providing good content is extraordinary. This seems like a good step in the right direction instead of things like likes on Instagram where their only value is self esteem. In addition, it’s not focused on appearance so it’s a lot less biased; anyone with a good thing to say will be upvoted no matter what they look like. 

Next is brave and BATS. I understand that if brave went mainstream then they would earn a ridiculous amount of money through advertisement but this would also then be split with the person that’s getting the advertisement shoved down their throat. I know I would personally prefer to get payed for being manipulated by ads then just be manipulated for free. Not to mention the other benefits brave has to offer. 

I think that this is just the start and I’m extremely excited to see where this concept of rewarding the user can go!",2021-04-11 17:51:16

"We all know ETH fees are high. Here's why it's happening, how to save money, and what is being done about it going forward.",4735,lcshic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lcshic/we_all_know_eth_fees_are_high_heres_why_its/,640,1612507635.0,"Full disclaimer: I own some ETH. I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

>What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

>Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

>How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

>What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)",2021-02-05 00:47:15

I am happy that the project inspired some of you to look for new and creative ways to make use of all the technologies available to us today and to improve of existing strategies. Many of you suggested some really good improvements to the bot and I am currently writing all the suggestions down in a plan to potentially release this as an application.

Here is a quick breakdown of what the bot does:

* It buys bitcoin if Elon talks positively about bitcoin on twitter
* It stops the loss at 5% and takes profit at 10%

And here are potential improvements based on your feedback:

* The bot should be able to work with multiple coins and keywords
* The bot should be able to follow multiple Twitter handles and ideally other websites too
* The bot should tweet the rocket emoji whenever it places a trade 🚀
* It should be user-configurable and ideally come with an easy to navigate user interface.
* The bot ideally analyses the weight of the influence on the crypto market for each influencer chosen

Your input made motivated me to release an official application for this project, and if you're comfortable with coding and would like to contribute drop me a message if you would like to collaborate on it!

If you have ideas on how the bot can improved leave them in the comments!

I spent them about a week later for diamonds in a minecraft server.

Now, you might be wondering why I wouldn't regret spending what is now worth half a million dollars on fake rocks in a videogame, but the more I've thought about the more I've realized:

- At $3 bitcoin still felt like a fun experiment. I had NO idea what I had. 
- More importantly, let's say I kept those coins. When Bitcoin hit $20 I would have been tempted to sell. When it hit $100 I would have been verrry tempted to sell. $1,000? I'd cash out for sure. There are so many milestones where I and many of us thought it was topping out where I without question would have so;d, especially in the early years. The likelihood of me keeping those coins for a decade with the assumption that today's prices were even possible at all is extremely unlikely.

Today, VeChain Foundation hosted the rebrand event showcasing the consortium chain VeChain to the public blockchain VeChainThor. This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. 

Sunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. 

This mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. 

Also in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:

* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) 

* VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. 

* VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. 

At the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.

In this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.

Luca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain “We are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases.” Luca went on to say:“DNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.”

I get constant recommendations in my Youtube of this clickbaity fuckers, even though I have selected ""Don't show anymore"" on Youtube, but I guess it doesn't care. And lucky me...because Bitboy has released a video titled: ""My $10 Million Crypto Portfolio REVEALED (Shocking Holdings)"".

First of all, there is nothing shocking in your holdings, besides the amount of coins that you have already accepted a sponsor of and didn't disclose it, which is illegal.

And this got me thinking of some coins that he has proclaimed that have a ""100x"" potential, so I decided to watch the video, and see if he puts his money where is mouth is. (I only know where he puts his mouth in for those thumbnails)

Well Lo and Behold...that must be one of the biggest self exposes I have seen in a while.

He has SEVERAL videos titled something similar to: ""BEST Low Cap Crypto Gem of 2021"", and GUESS WHAT!! He doesn't hold 2/10 coins that he pumps in those videos. But he does hold 300k USD...hmmm, where has that come from?

I know that one of his sponsored videos was about SOUL, where he named it the BEST LOW CAP GEM, and HE DOESN'T OWN IT. This is more than proof that he dumps soon after his video airs.

Frontier...same thing...naming it the coin with the best potential he has seen, and it is only 0.4% of his portfolio??? Yeah right. See it for yourself if you are interested...

Just wanted to leave this information here. THIS IS PROOF THAT WHOEVER LISTENS TO BITBOY CRYPTO IS BEING SCAMMED. And if he was investigated...oh boy...oh boy, he would certainly use that 😱😮 face quite a bit in jail.",2021-03-25 11:13:53

And today I noticed on the homepage that I reached 1 million trackers and ads blocked, which is pretty shocking. Additionally, I was essentially PAID to browse as I normally would -- with the recent run up in the price of BAT this amounts to \~$165. Obviously not a significant amount of money, but I think the concept is awesome regardless.

The browser itself works well, and the only issues I have with it are:

* You can only ""cash out"" via an Uphold wallet, which is KYC and has high fees.
* Some issues with receiving BAT payments on time.
* Can't enable BAT rewards on my iPhone, due to Apple's policy.

To those of you on the fence, I would suggest at least trying Brave. You can enable / disable BAT rewards (to earn BAT there are some pop-up ads that appear) as you please, so there's really no downside to giving it a shot. I think there are decent arguments on both sides about the value of the BAT token, so you can determine for yourself if enabling BAT ads are ""worth it"" for you.

A transfer from an external wallet/platform to GDAX appeared in all of our Coinbase accounts, and then said that it transferred successfully to our GDAX accounts, but then never showed up in our GDAX accounts. So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We’ve all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help. I really don’t know what else to do except try to get us on the front page of a bigger crypto community.

More details about this issue are here https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7mx88o/urgent_coinbase_to_gdax_transfer_disappeared/?st=JBUBPP35&sh=a19f1463

Thank you so much for your help to anybody who can spare an upvote to bring some attention to this.

If anybody from Coinbase finally wants to help, my support ticket number is 3221822

UPDATE: there’s a comment response from the Coinbase CEO, saying they’ll get to our tickets. Since I doubt they’ll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here’s my response:

What proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I’m even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.

One last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I’m familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.

UPDATE: it’s been 4 days and still missing all of my LTC

UPDATE: 5 days now. No more holidays. I have no faith in crypto exchanges anymore.

6 days now. What a joke. I’ll post the next update in 6 months when my support ticket gets addressed and if I’m lucky they’ll fix our problem.

FINAL UPDATE: Fixed finally after 6 and a half days.  My account has been transferred the litecoin that were missing, thank you so much everyone on reddit for bringing attention to this. I really owe everyone because I had no power at all over this situation and I like to think this post helped get Coinbase to at least address this issue. It would appear others are still having problems with this Coinbase to GDAX transfer, or at least haven’t had their missing coins returned yet, just as an FYI.

Each time people were saying the same things like ""Yes, now this is definitely the one that will replace Ethereum and I haven't missed the boat on it"" and guess what they never did. This is the boat I believe ADA is in. It isn't all just about the tech. Smart contracts are currently not as big in the world to the point where superior tech makes that big of a difference (hence why all the other ""Ethereum killers failed"" even with better tech). Ethereum has such a huge network effect as well as first-mover advantage where I can't see it getting flipped any time soon, especially with EIP 1559 coming out in July and ETH 2.0 being fully released (within a year?). At this point, most people/whales that are buying ETH are not in it for the tech but for what it is - the second most valued crypto (and generally more stable than the altcoins). Do I see ADA raising in value in the short-term or mid-term? Probably (assuming they deliver on what they say). Do I see it ever competing with ETH in the long term? Definitely not.

I later realized that a lot of people may not know the differences between a “coin” and a “token”, so I’m going to explain that here!

Let’s start off with what a blockchain even is! A blockchain is just software that is open source and distributed across many computers. These computers that run the blockchain software are considered “nodes”, and they keep track of the blockchain ledger, and any coins, tokens, and transactions associated with it.

The “coins” on the blockchain are just data (ones and zeroes) that is already written into the software. Using Bitcoin as an example, all 21 million Bitcoins are already in the Bitcoin software, and ownership of these coins is designated through the use of public and private keys, which gives the owners access to their Bitcoin on the blockchain. Also, with each new transaction block that is mined, new Bitcoins are awarded to the miners that processed these blocks. I touched on this whole process in my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) post.

In other words, “coins” on a blockchain are just part of the software itself, and are there from it’s inception.

Tokens work a bit differently, in that they’re smart contracts that are deployed onto a blockchain, and are not innate to the blockchain software itself. Using Ethereum as an example, a token (such as an ERC-20 token), is something that a user creates, and deploys onto the blockchain software via smart contracts. When a token is added to the blockchain, the creator of the token is able to write the rules for how a token will work i.e. the max supply, tokenomics, burn rate, functions, etc. All of this is handled in the smart contract portion of it’s creation. Tokens do not have their own blockchain, so they have to abide by the rules of the governing blockchain i.e. Ethereum.

CMC just tumbled the whole market with one move by excluding Korean exchanges from price calculations,4044,7oxivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7oxivj/cmc_just_tumbled_the_whole_market_with_one_move/,1064,1515433606.0,"Few hours ago Coin Market Cap removed Korean exchanges from their coin price calculations and being that all coins are about 30% pricier over there, it instantly tanked the price on CMC graphs. From what I see this is happening now : 

1. CMC removed Korean exchanges
2. Prices/graphs instantly tanked (but in practice not relevant to people outside Korea who dont trade there anyhow)
3. Large number of people did not recognize what actually happened and that there were not moves/selling on their western exchanges
4. Those same people are now dumping large amount of coins trying to ""cut loses"" because of the false impression that coin is crashing.
5. Random stuff happening

My opinion is that this should have been handled much better by CMC. At least put a banner saying ""WE HAVE EXCLUDED KOREAN EXCHANGES BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT AND IT WILL HAVE SUCH INFLUENCE ON CALCULATIONS"". I just hope they do not put back and remove those exchanges at random point in time. Any thoughts?",2018-01-08 11:46:46

Anyways, before anybody discredits me, I am studying Computer Science and have been able to land some nice internships, so yes, I admit that I'm not an expert and there are many things I don't know, however I would consider myself someone that has been exposed to basic Computer Science concepts, and more advanced ones in Algorithms, Data Structures and Cryptography.

With that out of the way, I just wanted to say that there are a lot of people here giving recommendations to new people (which is great) and there is this specific one that really irks me, ""Read the whitepaper"". Why does it annoy me so much?

* Well, for starters I highly doubt that people giving these recommendations even read the whitepapers themselves, I honestly believe that they say this in order to look like ""responsible investors"" or ""being in it for the tech"", whatever their motives are, I believe that 99% are lying.
* For the tiny minority that actually reads the whitepapers, I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but I highly doubt you understand the important technical part of the whitepapers completely. I say this because I've taken several high level CS courses in college and I struggle every time to grasp some concepts that describe how a certain project works and what makes it significant. I am certainly no guru, but I believe that I know more CS than the vast majority of people who are trying to get into crypto, and if someone like me can't understand what these whitepapers say, how exactly will a newcomer get any benefit from trying to read these documents?

You know, I remember I got into crypto right when I started college, and even now 3 years later, I prefer just watching a simplified video about a project than trying to read the whitepaper, which I know will be a waste of time. There is a reason why most projects upload a simplified version that explains how the project works, and that's so that newcomers can get an idea of what the project is. Odds are that the vast majority of people trying to buy a certain cryptocurrency will be people that just don't have the background required to understand whitepapers, so let's stop recommending them to read whitepapers and instead recommend them something different, like watching videos or reading simplified articles that explain what the cryptocurrency that they want to buy is.",2021-03-31 08:56:30

As more and more newbies jump in the field, I wanted to share some security tips outside the typical “not your keys, not your wallet” type security as there’s other ways to be hit

1.) [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) enter your email and see what data breaches your email(s) have been apart of. I recently helped a fellow reddit user who said his account was hacked, turns out he was part of a breach where a crypto site was hacked and his password was exposed, he reused this password on another crypto site that the attacker crossed referenced with his email / pass from the other site and didn’t have 2FA activated.

With that don’t reuse passwords, and use auto generated passwords / store them in a encrypted password manager (I use [KeePass](https://keepass.info/))

2.) Every single program/software is essentially a attack vector, keep your OS updated, keep your software updated, and uninstall ANY thing you don’t use anymore. Just look up the SolarWinds hack and see how supply chain attacks work.

3.) Don’t download random stuff from this site or any other. If you want to, check the hash of the software. This can be done using “Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256” in the windows cmd (Linux you can use “sha256sum ‘filename’”) you can then enter the hash into [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) to see if it comes back malicious.

4.) Keeping your seed phrase safe, I personally store it in a KeePass database file (encrypted) then put that file on 2 USB drives and store it in 2 different secure locations.

5.) typical advice: Don’t engage reddit messages, don’t disclose your portfolio, cold wallets, and activate 2FA on your reddit account to keep your moons safe.

EDIT: 

6.) Don’t trust email links, I’ve actually worked with the owner of haveibeenpwned owned on a “breach” I found where I found over 12K emails that were entered into phishing sites, and reported it to him. Always go to the site directly through the url address (and double check it)

7.) ALSO! Forgot one of the most important ones, chrome extensions, these can have keyloggers, take screenshots, and track you. It might not be malicious when you downloaded it, but attackers generally 
 update them with malicious code with those capabilities or aren’t updated at all which leads to potential unfixed vulnerabilities. Double check the ones you have installed, and remove any you don’t need.

8.) VPN / Browser, use a vpn with a no log policy to encrypt your network traffic. I personally use ProtonVPN and it’s worth the few bucks a month for a paid version, brave also allows you to use TOR in browser. Another option is hardening Firefox to use as a browser if brave doesn’t suite your needs which a guide can be found [here](https://informinc.org/internet/how-to-harden-your-firefox-browser-for-security-and-privacy/)

EDIT EDIT:
I’ve gotten a lot of messages regarding how to get into the Cybersecurity field and trying my best to respond to them, if there’s interest I could make a post about that at some point. 

If so please feel free to leave questions below, that you would like answered in case it doesn’t come to mind when writing it / trying my best to respond.",2021-04-21 02:29:23
DeFi explained: Smart contracts,3999,me9p7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/me9p7h/defi_explained_smart_contracts/,599,1616862139.0,"What is a smart contract? How do smart contracts work? And what are they good for? I'll try to answer these questions in this post.

## What are smart contracts?

A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties in the form of computer code. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed. Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

## What can smart contracts do?

Smart contracts help you exchange money, stock or anything else of value in a transparent, trustless manner, all while avoiding the services of an intermediary and the possibility of conflict. Smart contracts provide you:

* Autonomy - You are the one who makes the deal and you don't have to rely on an intermediary to confirm transactions. The execution is automatically managed by a decentralized network, which excludes manipulation of contracts.
* Speed ​​- Automated contracts can save you hours on manual paperwork.
* Security - Smart contracts are secured with similar cryptography that encrypts websites. In short, it keeps your documents safe.
* Savings - Because they disable the presence of an intermediary, smart contracts can save you a lot of money. Where, for example, you would normally have to pay a notary to witness your transaction, this is now regulated by the blockchain.
* Backup - Unlike files on your computer, data on the blockchain is duplicated many times over. So you do not have to be afraid of losing something that is registered on the blockchain. Also, there is no way anyone can say they lost the contract or the dog ate it.

## A smart contract in effect

As an example; If you were to register cinema tickets on the blockchain using a smart contract, then as a visitor you will receive the tickets in your personal wallet. You only have to show the address to which the tickets were sent upon entry and the cinema can immediately be sure that you do not have any fake tickets and that you have actually paid for your tickets. This gives a better customer experience and the cinema can save a lot of costs in this way because it no longer needs ticket processing services.

## But why is this so safe?

Thanks to blockchain technology, we can decentralize smart contracts so that they are fair and trusted. Decentralization means that they are not controlled by one central party, such as a bank or the government.

The blockchain is a shared database managed by many different computers (nodes). As a result, not one person or company has control over it. It also means that it is almost impossible to hack it and therefore smart contracts can be executed securely and automatically without anyone being able to change them.

## Best practices for smart contracts

In principle, smart contracts can be used for any type of transaction, it does not have to be financial. Here are some industries where smart contracts can be used conveniently.

## Insurances

The insurance world could be shaken up considerably by blockchain technology. An example of a smart contract was a project run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offered flight insurance that were paid out if the policyholder's flight was delayed by more than two hours. AXA was running a pilot project that payed out insurance via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Unfortunately the project has been discontinued.

The smart contract worked with an “if / then function”: IF the flight was delayed by more than two hours, THEN the policyholder would be paid. Because the smart contract was connected to a database that keeps track of flight times, the function could be performed automatically and paid for via the Ethereum blockchain. This would have saved a lot of time for AXA, but also for the policyholder. This is just one example of the many options that smart contracts offer.

## Healthcare

Within healthcare, smart contracts will be used to record and securely transfer data. We can already see examples of smart contracts used in the medical industry, such as the company Encrypgen, for example. This is an application that uses blockchain to transfer patient data in a secure manner, eliminating the need for third-party access. In this way, the patients are in control of their own data. If researchers want to use patient data, they have to pay for it. The patient also chooses whether the data may be sold or not.

## Governments

Governments guarantee that it is extremely difficult to manipulate the voting system, but despite that, smart contracts could alleviate all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Smart contracts could also prevent low voter turnout. Much of the small turnout is due to a clunky system consisting of lining up a queue, showing your identity, and filling out forms. With the use of smart contracts, anyone can transfer their votes securely online, which is expected to generate much more response.

## Business management

There is still a lot of room for improvement within business management and smart contracts can help a lot. Why do administration when everything is registered on the blockchain anyway? Right, the blockchain is already doing the work for you. You also do not have to make a pay slip every month. The money automatically goes to your employees as soon as they have fulfilled the agreements. Companies can simply set up a smart contract that states: IF the date is 10/20/2020, THEN $2500 will be sent to employee A. This means that employees will always be paid on time and that they will never be underpaid. The advantage of the company is that it is all automated, saving them a lot of time and money!

## Fundraising (ICOs)

In principle, anyone could create their own token and sell it to the general public in order to raise money for a project. In 2017 there was a real ICO craze, where some projects managed to raise tens of millions within hours. There was even an EOS ICO that lasted for a year and racked up more than $ 4 billion in total!

If you want to organize an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) you create a token and a contract to sell the token. The function of the smart contract in this case would be: if person A sends an X amount of ETH, person A gets an X amount of tokens.

## Smart contracts in a nutshell

The most important features of a smart contract are:

* Digital Agreement - A smart contract is an agreement in the form of computer code.
* Blockchain - Transactions are processed by a public database, based on blockchain technology.
* Confidentiality - A transaction can only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

## Conclusion

It will be a while before smart contracts are everywhere in everyday life, but we can say with some certainty that the technology has a lot to offer.

I hope this post helped you with:

* Getting a better understanding of smart contracts
* Understanding the significance of smart contracts within the crypto space.

Here’s a reminder for y’all lurkers here or a wake up call for people who actually take the time of day to shitpost:

1. Nobody who’s even close to being a big player or is knowledgeable about the market is wasting their time on fucking r/cryptocurrency 

2. Most “advice” you get on here is from hodlboys or plain shills trying to jerk their own dicks by echoing the same copy paste moon statements. By the occasional mercy of god there’s a post that makes life worth living but those are usually rare. This post is also not one of them.

3. No you won’t get rich hodling a mass shilled top 100 coin for a week, a month, maybe a year. Jesus Christ if it took early bitcoin miners years to go from a couple hundred to almost 20k you won’t make it with a short term focus.

4. Putting a couple hundred or thousand dollars does not make you an “investor” or at all knowledgeable about blockchain. Losing your money sucks learn from mistakes instead of dragging others down. 

5. Comments that say “3k next it’s over boys” with 30 upvotes does NOT legitimize that claim, assume it’s 31 idiots sharing a herd mentality with no basis for their arbitrary prediction.

6. Anything that has to do with price on r/cryptocurrency should not be taken as financial advice. Nobody on this sub actually know which way the markets will turn, TA works in very niche circumstances and cannot predict movements based around obvious facts or fundamental trends.

That’s all I have to say for now, my fingers are tired. I’ve been in the space for some years now and this sub is a place I frequent despite all the cancerous shit I see daily. The memes are fucking comedy gold and I will always love you guys for being here with me.

TL;DR do your own fucking research and don’t listen to anyone announcing the direction this market is heading.

EDIT: Some people apparently are not seeing the point of this post or get some kind of joy mocking if. Allow me to make some things clear:

No I’m not angry or have any personal salt nor am I projecting my expectations of what this sub SHOULD be but rather I’m only letting people know what this sub IS at the moment and what to be wary for. I was once new to the space and foolishly trusted the advice stemming from fickle sentiments and made mistakes doing so. All I hope to achieve with this post is for people to realize that this is not the place for accurate predictions regarding market movement and to be careful, That’s all.

#The Elation  
For me, I kept talking to my good friend M about Bitcoin. He told me about it in September and through October to November we watched it sail past $10,000, to $15,000 before we decided to dip our toes. He was dead set on Ripple and bought at about $0.20, and was supposed to come over and show me how to set it up, but on his way over, he was T-boned by a careless driver and we postponed it. In the days after, Ripple shot up and I felt like I missed the boat, and he tipped me off about another good project called ""Cardano""  

*Oh, those merry times*  

I bought some in mid December, and let me tell you that what happened was absolutely insane. For starters, Coinbase was so fucked from the insane level of sign ups, that they couldn't process new accounts. It took **THREE WEEKS** for my account to be verified, and I had to buy Bitcoin from Local Bitcoins, transfer to Binance and then swap to Cardano. What a joke, but hey I got my Cardano. Little did we realise, we were just 1 month from the top. We enjoyed stratospheric gains for one month.  

It felt different than this February, where gains have been ridiculous. Back then, you could've put your money on nearly anything and 8-10x'd in a couple weeks flat. Someone on this reddit described it really well - your money doubled, then doubled again. You'd think ""Surely this is it"", then it doubled again. Finally, it doubled again. And then once more.  

I bought 2 days before the Bitcoin top. I had no idea what happens next.  

For the unaware, alts don't really go up when BTC goes up. Money flows out of alts, into BTC as it gains. When BTC dips, it takes the market with it. But BTC rising up doesn't really take the market up because there are so many who take money out of alts to ride BTC's wave. **The best time to be in alts, is when BTC goes flat**  

And that's kinda what happened. And alts exploded.  

My small Cardano buy doubled, and then doubled, and again and again. Every day I woke up to more green in the portfolio. My mate was making bank off Ripple - it went from 20c to over $3.00. I cursed myself for not just buying Ripple at 44c or whatever it was, and I bought some at $3.15 - basically the top of the market, Ripple's highest ever price.  

I also bought some bags. FunFair went mad, why not, I'll have some. Saw crazy profit on that. ETHLend going mad? Go on then. TRON? Go on then!  

There was no wrong decision in that frenzy.  

Until there was.  

#The Copium  
The gains leveled out. Some days started to get red. Everyone was saying shit like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Wall Street Bonuses"", ""Korea FUD"". Nobody can pin why the bubble popped, but in any assets history, such an incredible period of growth just cannot be sustained. I think it was South Korea basically taking some exchanges offline and it fucked with Coin Stat websites. People panicked and sold. That caused more panic, and more sales.  

The daily gains turned red, very quickly.  

""It's just a dip"" ""Hold!"" ""We need a correction"" was the hopium of the day. Anyone ballsy enough sold, probably everyone who had been in this space since 2016. They'd seen it all before.  

Some coins slowly turned from green, to breakeven, to red.  

And it just kept going down. I remember a brief rally in April. It was a suckers rally, in May my altcoins were mostly back in profit. It went down again. Same thing in August, BTC spiked up, we all thought ""Finally, this is it!"" and then it came back down again. Over and over.

Small blips aside, the Bitcoin bear market lasted from Mid December 2018 to Mid March 2020. That's 15 months, and only then did it start rising properly. We had a false start in early 2019 after the babyish chain split of Bitcoin Cash into BCH and BSV, which plummeted the market into one of the lowest prolonged periods of red I have seen. At this point, many people were down some -80% to -95%, me included.  

#The Effect  
How did it feel? Well to be honest, weird. But it happened over such a long period of time, you just become numb to it. In fact, after periods where your portfolio barely moves 3% in a week, you actually come to enjoy the wild volatility, even when the arse is falling out of it.  

It never stops though, in October 2018, we experienced one of the sharpest in memory, when a childish squabble between Roger Ver and Craig Wright forked the Bitcoin Cash chain into BCH and Bitcoin ""Satoshi's Vision"" (christ)  

This resulted in an absolutely gut-wrenching drop which lasted until early 2019.  

Some days, the losses and gains really did affect my day to day. I've received a couple warnings from work about chart-watching and I've been snappy or elated depending on how much I lost or gained in a day. Now I just truly don't care. I have a target and if I get there, good, if not, I'll wait.

#Is that a light I see?  
2019 started out quite nicely. Price remained stable in the $3,000's until April, where it all started climbing back up again. Alts came along for the ride too. On the summer solstice, BTC broke past $10,000. I smiled as I checked my portfolio, the same day I proposed to my gorgeous fiancee *(that covers my ass in case she reads this)*. Were things looking up?  

Myeh, not quite. This period of >$10,000 lasted until about September and we came back down. Again, a quiet Christmas and then the hope of a new year brought prices up again just nosing past $10,000.  

Up to this point, I had been buying a bunch of stuff. I bought some Golem, it tripled in one of those spikes in 2018 and then I held a worthless token. My ETHLend, Funfair and Tron were basically worthless. The only times I was in profit was when Cardano, Eth or Ripple stirred from their sleep.  

My first Bitcoin buy, to actually buy and keep, was in fuckin November 2019. I set up a monthly buy, but then stopped halfway through 2020 - with Coronavirus, I could've been out of work at a moments notice so all crypto buying stopped.  

In March 2020, we saw Crypto nosedive as Coronavirus struck. This one sucked. In hindsight, these prices were a **fucking steal** - I had the balls to put only one buy in, Cardano at $0.035 and $0.038 - last week, these appreciated 31x and 27x respectively.  

And that was basically the bottom. All has risen from there.  

I made some massive, massive mistakes. I held certain shitcoins way too long, and sold ETHLEND when I broke even on it, because I didn't do any research and didn't get why it was climbing so quickly, which ultimately cost me about $4,500 in wasted gains.

I think the best thing I did was consolidate my entire portfolio. All the shit from Coinbase Earn, I just moved it all into Stellar. All the other crap, I just tied it into the good projects and Bitcoin.  

So does this current dip feel like that bear market? No. It just feels like a correction on the way to something bigger. But I do think we will see, until June, some sideways and mostly negative price action broken up with a few days of gains at a time.  

Some cardinal rules for Crypto:  

* This market is fucking irrational. It doesn't make sense that EOS enjoyed periods of insane growth after the network was basically so congested it was not functional, or after people found out that 98% of the transactions on the network was just blocks filling up with weather data from around the world...  
* Do not ever, **ever** leverage yourself to buy Crypto. I'm talking loans, credit card debt, spending money reserved for rent or mortgage. This market can and will change in the blink of an eye and it's not worth the risk.  
* **Time in the market** is truly better than **timing the market**. I tried trading a handful of times and it was a fantastic way of basically just setting fire to my money. I think my most successful trade I earned about 20 ""free"" ADA. The worst trade I did, I lost about £50 before I figured fuck it.  
* Do some fucking research! I mentioned earlier, I sold ETHLEND before it transformed into AAVE. I sold at $0.12. At it's peak, it was worth about $5.40. It annoys me nearly every fucking day.  
* We are early. Yeah, we really are. Someone on here mentioned that most people can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or does. Get in, stay in. Ride until you can take out your principal and the rest is free money.  
* Don't take it so seriously. This shit definitely affected my day-to-day. You need to learn to let it go and roll with the punches. I put in a marginal amount maybe once a month and it still felt horrible the first few times I saw deep red in the portfolio.

"A beginner's guide to limit orders, stop orders, and stop limit orders",3645,lolbo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lolbo6/a_beginners_guide_to_limit_orders_stop_orders_and/,212,1613897986.0,"Someone in the daily said they couldn't wrap their mind around stop limit orders, so I replied to them with what ended up being a rather massive explanation for the 3 types of orders in the post title. I think a lot of beginners (both in the stock market and crypto) struggle with these concepts, so I thought I would post the entire explanation as a guide. So, here it is!

Ok, so there are **limit orders**, **stop orders**, and **stop-limit orders**. The third one combines the concepts of the first two.

Let's start with a sell **limit order.** Perhaps you hold a bunch of some asset currently at $1. You decide that if it hits $1.50, you want to sell. So you make a limit sell order. This is simply an order that will be automatically triggered at the first opportunity to sell at or above the limit price you chose, $1.50. It will only fill if you can get a price equal to or better than the limit price. You're basically publishing an offer to the world, saying ""if ever anyone wants to buy at $1.50 or higher, I am down, and my computer will automatically do the trade with you"".

But imagine you also want to automatically sell if it gets to $0.50 or lower, because you believe that would indicate free fall and you'd want to just cut your losses. A sell limit order wouldn't work here, because a limit order is triggered so long as it can be filled at the limit price or better. So, if you set a sell limit for $0.50 while the price is currently $1.00, it would be instantly triggered and your position would be sold at $1.00, because $1.00 satisfies the condition of being equal to or better than the $0.50 limit price. So, this doesn't do what you want. That's were stop orders (aka stop-losses) come in. A **stop order** will trigger a sell at the best available market price once the stop price has been reached. So, if you set the stop price to $0.50, then once the market price passes below that threshold, your position will be sold at the best available market price in that moment (which will usually be very very close to the stop price you set).

So, here is the difference between a limit order and a stop order: in a limit order, the limit price is just a threshold above which you will accept a trade and below which you will not. It's basically like an open offer to sell at some price. With a stop order, the stop price is not a threshold below which you will accept a trade. Instead, it is a trigger: once the market price passes your stop price, then your position will be sold instantly to the highest bidder in that moment.

Now, this means that usually your position will be sold basically right at the stop price (or very close, like $0.4998), because if your position is being sold to the highest bidder the moment the price touches your stop price, the highest bidder will basically be buying at the stop price. However, there are exceptions.

For example, in the stock market, there is after-hours trading when you can't trade, but special people can. Now, imagine the day closes with the price at $0.55, and your stop price is $0.50. During after hours, a bunch of whales dump the stock, and by open tomorrow morning, it is at $0.20. Your stop loss will be instantly triggered and you will sell at $0.20, not $0.50 like you wanted. This is because the triggering event of the market price passing your stop price happened (during after hours), so the position was sold at the earliest possible time at the highest available price, which happened to be at market open the next day at $0.20.

Another example is this: imagine a gigantic whale decides to sell an absurd amount of your crypto just a tiny bit above your stop loss price, at like $0.501. This triggers a massive selloff and the price drops off a cliff. It therefore drops past your stop price, so automatically you get in line to sell at the highest available price. But the demand to buy at $0.50 has already come and gone, and there aren't enough buyers to keep up with the sellers, so by the time your transaction actually gets filled, it ends up being at $0.45, not $0.50. This is called price slippage, by the way.

A third example: imagine your exchange goes down for 10 minutes when the price is at $0.52, but once it comes back 10 minutes later, the price is at $0.25, since other exchanges were running during those 10 minutes. Now your stop order will be filled at $0.25. Not ideal.

This finally brings us to the **stop limit.** The stop limit combines both limit orders and stop losses. They require that you specify two prices: the stop price, and the limit price. If the market price passes the stop price, that triggers the creation of a limit order with the limit price you specified. Let's consider a couple cases where you might want to use this.

Let's say, like before, you believe if the price gets as low as $0.50, then that signals that you need to exit. However, you are definitely not willing to sell below $0.30. You would rather just hold and hope it recovers one day than sell that low. So, you make a stop limit order where the stop price is $0.50 and the limit price is $0.30. The moment the price gets as low as $0.50, the stop will be triggered, which will then create a limit order whose limit price is $0.30. So, the stop price is the trigger to decide you want to make a sell offer, and the limit price is the lowest you are willing to sell for once the stop trigger actually happens. 99% of the time, this stop limit order will mean you end up selling basically right at $0.50, just like the stop order we talked about earlier. Once the stop price is passed, your limit order will be created for $0.30, which will immediately be filled at like $0.499, because that is the current price, and it satisfies the condition of the limit order, which is to sell at or above the limit price of $0.30. However, in the off-chance that your stop price is triggered at $0.50, but the price then somehow teleports down to $0.25 (after hours trading, price slippage, or your exchange going down) then your position would not be sold, because the price is below the limit price you set. If the price eventually recovered to $0.30, your position would then be sold at that price, if you hadn't cancelled it by then.

Another use case would be this. Say, once again, you believe that if the price drops below $0.50, that is a red flag that you should exit your position. However, you believe that if it does get that low, there is a very good chance that there will be a dead cat bounce (where something makes a short-lived partial recovery while it is in its death throes). You bet that, if this coin gets as low as $0.50, it will briefly make it back up to $0.70 before crashing fully and dying. So, you make a stop limit order with $0.50 stop price, and a $0.70 limit price. If ever the price gets as low as $0.50, you will now automatically publish an offer to sell at $0.70 (ie: a limit order with $0.70 limit price will be created). If the price now rebounds up to $0.70 like you thought it would, your order will be filled and you will sell at $0.70. If it doesn't end up rebounding that high, your order won't be filled, and you'll end up holding. It's like saying ""I believe if we go as low as $0.50, that's a good indication we are crashing hard, so I will try to exit at $0.70 shortly thereafter during a bounce, but if I can't get that good of a deal, I guess I'll just hold and hold and hope it recovers one day"".

So, in summary: A **limit order** is an open offer to sell at a certain price or better that you publish to the market. A **stop order** is a trigger threshold, which, if passed, means your position will be sold ASAP at current market price. A **stop limit order** is a trigger threshold, which, if passed, creates a limit order.

Finally, I want to note that all these examples have to do with selling, but these types of orders exist for buying as well. It works the same way, but everything is flipped. For example, if you want to buy a coin, but only if it dips below $0.25 so that it's affordable to you, then you would make a limit buy order with $0.25 as the limit price, and you would automatically buy that position if ever someone is willing to sell at that price (ie: the market price dips that low). 

I hope this helps somebody!",2021-02-21 02:59:46

Its taken a long time but finally gone down below that.

You've probably heard many people tell you it would eventually happen back in December 2017 and to reduce expose to crypto [(including me)](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7l7k9i/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017/drl2esi/), but when you're hyped up on 20% gains every week its hard to be cautious or engage in defensive measures. To many the last quarter of 2017 and into early 2018 was like a beach party with coke and Victoria Secret models. Who wants to listen to someone tell you about how you're gonna crash hard with a headache the next morning?

With this latest crash, Bitcoin's price is back to roughly mid October 2017, which is roughly when the mainstream mania started. Many on this sub entered after October 2017 and hence are now left holding heavy bags. Many are down 80% or even 90%.  Here is the current losses from ATH for the top cryptos:

Asset | Loss from ATH
-- | --
BTC | -77%
XRP | - 88%
ETH | -90%
BCH | -95%
XLM | -79%
EOS | -83%
LTC | -91%
ADA | -96%
XMR | -85%
TRN | -96%

**Who do we blame?**
--------------------------------------------------

At a time like this its easy to get angry, to look at someone to blame. Whether Roger Ver and the hash wars, whether BAAKT delay, whether whales or SEC or institutions, everyone has their favorite boogeyman. No one thing is the reason why the market is down 80%. 

The reality is that Bitcoin (and all other crypto by extension) was ovevalued even by grossly overoptimistic measures. Its not BAKKT or the whales trying to get your coins for cheap. The same people who were buying at near peak bubble thinking they were getting into the chance of a lifetime are prone to look for someone to blame for their losses, when it was actually their fault for buying near the end of a mania. 

Nobody wants to admit that it was their own greed, lack of research and irrational behavior that lead to the gross overvaluation of all cryptocurrency.

**Is it over yet?**
--------------------------------------------------

The $6K consolidation was likely a result of the market coiling tighter and tighter around the mining breakeven point for some of the smaller miners. The big firms in China are profitable mining below 6K, but many smaller ones in the US and Europe aren't. You can actually [see the total hash rate going down](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate). Once it broke it was a big fall straight down. 

Bitcoin is mined at 12.5 BTC. per block at 10 minute blocks, which comes out to around 1800 BTC every day. This 1800 BTC has to be absorbed by every day, which means the following at different price levels:

Price Level | Daily net buying needed to absorb mined coins
---|---
6000 | $10.8 million/day
4500 | $8.1 million/day
3000 | $5.4 million/day

At the current price, at least theoretically $8.4 million in demand is needed to cover the mining output. Of course the miners don't immediately dump it all, but it shows why miners have an incentive to keep the price high and try to incite FOMO with a BGD. 

I can also see that after this latest drop, the ""buy the dip"" sentiment had substantially gone down, at least compared to the other fast drops in price. This is especially discouraging those who were waiting for the ""November bull run"", which never came. Its clear to more people now that this probably isn't just downward correction that will reverse, but a multiyear bear market. This is why the bounce has been so weak compared to earlier in the year. Compare that to the last two big 2 day drops:

* March 29 - April 1st (drop from 8K to 6K): Within 2 days it bounced back up to 7.5K

* June 22-24 (drop from 6.8K to 5.8K): Within 2 days it bounced back to 6.3K

The weakness of this current bounce says it all, people are no longer optimistic that BAKKT or ETF or any other catalyst will lead to a bull run that they can cash out quick. It may be a period of stagnation followed by further drops as big holders take profits.

I also think that the FED tightening with rate hikes is leading to a lot more volatility not only in stocks, but crypto as well. Right now asset deflation seems to be a global macro risk as cheap credit dries up, and Bitcoin surely isn't immune from this.

My personal view is that at this point we may see further declines, but calling what's going to happen next is always dangerous. A whale (especially a big mining operation) with a series of large orders to clear out the order book on Bitfinex could give us a BGD out of nowhere at any time and take us back to 6K, it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to something like that. But I'm not betting on it leading to any sustained rally past 10K. Quite the opposite.

---------------------------------------------------

So what's a crypto shrimp to do? I'll split my thoughts into two, for those who are still in the green and those in the loss.

**If you're still in the green**
--------------------------------------------------


If you're still in profit, this is a great time to consider how much more downward selling you can take and also how you can hedge downward risk.

If you're someone who purchased when Bitcoin was below $1000, you should [calculate your compounded annual ROI](https://financial-calculators.com/roi-calculator) and decide if that return is good enough for you. For equities, the long term average is about 10% per year, 20-30% in a good bull market. 

Its your decision, but taking out profits that exceed principal and reinvesting the principal is not at all a bad idea. For those who invested before Bitcoin reached $1K (April 2017) the current price is still an insane return that no other asset class can match.

Another important thing is to think about how you can hedge the risk of downward movement. This is where derivative exchanges are very useful, although you do need to do some research on how derivatives work and how to not get liquidated. If you have substantial holdings, the effort to learn this is worth it. 

The basic idea is that you can buy short contracts that increase in value as Bitcoin goes down, proportional to the amount of leverage you put to finance the contract. If managed correctly, you can protect your entire stack with a portion as leverage. Its something commonly done by miners, who short Bitcoin with derivatives to hedge their holdings.

**If you're in the loss**
--------------------------------------------------


The untold reality is that HODL is a meme told to newbies to prevent panic selling during a downturn while the smart money cashes out in a more orderly fashion. But does that mean you shouldn't hold if you're already down massively? 

Well that depends on your own life situation, how much you've invested, and if you don't need the money for the next few years.

Mathematically, whether it drops to 4.5K or 3K from the reference of 6K is highly meaningful, its a drop of 25% or 50%. But if your reference starting point is much higher, then it really doesn't matter all that much. A drop from 17K to 4.5K is a 74% loss while down to 3K it would be 82%, massive losses either way. In that sense if this is money you don't need, it makes sense to simply have it stored in a wallet and forget about it for a few years. Who cares if it drops further after a certain point if you don't plan to take it out for a while? Its like in equities markets where people with massive losses don't sell, but instead move the loss position into their retirement fund where they don't plan to take it out for a long time and thus are giving it time to rebound back.

But what if its money you need? What if like many out there you took out loans hoping to catch a run to 50K? If you have high interest debt (credit cards...etc), focus on paying that down first. Credit cards generally have high interest and many compound daily, so pay down the debt first rather than trying to pay your debts off with a crypto bull run that may take years to materialize.

This is also a good learning opportunity. It is worrying how few people who hold crypto have a clue what any of this even is or how it works. [I've always recommended this video to explain how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

A good thing to do during catastrophic losses is to honestly access why you got suckered into buying high in the first place. Most people here are young, and this is a valuable lesson in why you shouldn't follow the herd.  Everyone is a genius in a bull market, everyone is chasing the next hype. Crypto tends to attract people looking for a get-rich-quick-without-effort crowd, but it takes some mental effort to understand this beyond the buzzwords. Take the time to understand the fundamental reasons why an asset has value and what factors would drive its rise once the hype dies down. What makes Bitcoin valuable, what makes some of the other cryptoassets valuable? If those fundamentals in some way changes, so should your opinion. 

Its also a great opportunity to help in its adoption by using it. The irony of it all is that people demand that they get rich because of the hard work of buying a bunch of crypto in an exchange and transferring it to their wallet, without any understanding what they're buying into. 

Also don't be angry. Don't look to blame. Look to learn and improve next time you invest.

6. Market takes a dump and the Hedge Funds Made Billions buying BTC Low and selling high while at the same time NAILING their short call on Future Market.

OK GREAT HEIST RIGHT?  BUT WAIT THATS NOT ALL.

7. Hedge Funds Managers and Wealthy Elite go LONG on BCME Future which is due 10 days after the first futures call.
8. Market takes a complete nose dive back to 9k and gues who is their to start buying again?  Thats right the Hedge Fund Managers and Wealthy Elite.
9. With their newly made BILLIONS the Hedge Fund Managers push the price back up over course of 7 days in order to hit their LONG CALL on 2nd Futures market.

If you see a spike in the price of BTC and overall market cap after 1pm PST today (when 1st future call settles) you will have witnessed one of the greatest robberies of ALL TIME.

"NFT Madness - What they are and what they are not. Why they're great, and why they suck.",3156,lzjuf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lzjuf7/nft_madness_what_they_are_and_what_they_are_not/,780,1615122987.0,"NFTs are the hottest new topic in the Crypto scene, blowing up enough to even garner a good bit of public attention outside of the usual crypto fanatic outlets.  The only problem with this is that beyond the surface level idea, *no one knows what they are or how they actually work.*

It's time to shine a little light on NFTs, and take a proper, *deep* dive into how they work, and how many people are ***getting scammed via NFTs.***


Now then.  Let's begin.

#1. What are NFTs, really?

Everyone knows the analogy of them being collectibles.  Unfortunately this analogy is woefully inadequate at best, and actively malicious at worst.

NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) as an umbrella term just means that each digital token on the network is unique.  Each token contains some small bit of data that is unique to the token in question.  That's it.  They're just little data containers being shipped around the blockchain between addresses.

Now, NFTs on specifically Ethereum have a few data points that are unique to why anyone cares about them.  (It's also likely other networks will implement some or all of these features, if they have not already.)

1.  NFTs have their creator's address saved as part of the NFT.  Likewise, the current owner of the NFT is public information as well.

2.  A Royalty % may be set in the NFT token.  When the NFT is then traded *at any point in time, between any two addresses* for ETH/currency, the royalty cut of that 'sale' will be redirected to the *Creator*'s ETH address.

Now, before we go any further, it's important to understand one more aspect of NFTs.  ***NFTs are very, very small.***  It is exorbitantly expensive to store real data on a blockchain, even something as small as a 64x64 jpg.  Most NFTs are only going to have a few *bytes* of data stored in them.  Like, for example, a serial number or URL.

In short ***an NFT is basically a unique scrap of paper with a serial number, password, or web address on it.***  That's it.


#2.  What NFTs -are NOT-

NFTs are ***not*** digital media.  They do not store the digital media on the blockchain.  If you buy an NFT for some image or song, what you're really getting is a Token with a URL to a song or image, hosted on some random webserver.

NFTs do not prevent copying, alteration, deletion, or any other actions regarding any digital or physical thing they link to.

NFTs ***do not inherently confer ownership over any assets they link to.***

Again, before we continue, let's take a brief moment to review:  ***NFTs are just unique tradable 'scraps ' with a small amount of information scribbled on it.***

#3.  So how do these scraps of paper get value?


NFTs have a few potential ways to *actually* mean something.

**1 -  The NFT may unlock some functionality, feature, etc. when connected to some external system.**

NBA Topshot implements this, for example.  Your NBA Topshot token effectively has value via interacting with their systems to display the 'moment' it represents on their website.  It's important to understand here, that if NBA TopShot went under, the TopShot tokens would immediately become 'worthless', as you would no longer be able to access the 'NBA Moments' they represent.

The same is true, for example, for CryptoKitties.  If their site/etc. goes down, your CryptoKitty tokens are now meaningless/function-less.

In both these cases, your NFT is basically just a trade-able serial number that represents a 'Moment' or 'CryptoKitty' on their servers, and allows you to interact with said 'Moment' or 'Kitty' via their application.

Another more off the wall example in this space is you could have NFTs which may be submitted to an application that then burns(destroys) them in exchange for sending you some physical good or service, such as a t-shirt.

**2 -  The creator of some media (or physical thing) may sell legal rights to the media along with the sale of an NFT.**

Now, this one gets *problematic*, ***fast***, and is where many people are getting scammed.

1.  There is no guarantee the user you are buying the NFT from actually owns rights to the thing represented/linked to by the NFT.

2.  In order to legally transfer rights/ownership/etc. you must put it on paper paper/document it.  (And for larger items like a house or business, this requires significant legal information in the documentation).


What this means, is that if you want to buy 'ownership' of some linked asset via its NFT, you have to do your own diligence to ensure:

1.  They are the current copyright owner.

2.  They are consenting, in writing, to selling the rights to you with/via the NFT, and included whatever legal documentation is necessary, if any additional is required.

At that point you can guarantee you've at least bought ownership rights of the thing.  However, there's no reason you can't simply *sell those ownership rights independent of the NFT* in the future.

In short, there is *nothing legally tying NFTs to digital rights ownership at present*.

**3 - Unique/secret data**

In this case, an NFT would contain some variety of unique data, only visible to the address it is owned by, such as a unique URL, or password to a secret clubhouse.  If the buyer has a reasonable belief that this information is still secret, buying/trading the NFT  becomes the primary way to obtain it.  Some Rarible sales attempt to go this route, however, the issue here is obvious.  It's the internet, nothing stays secret for long, and you have no guarantee that the creator or previous owners have not shared the secret information into the wild.

#4. How you are going to get scammed.

1.  Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of a thing when the seller doesn't own the thing to start with.

2.  Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of the thing without ever actually getting it in writing/legally enforceable.

3.  Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of the thing and getting non-exclusive rights (instead of exclusive rights to the thing), meaning the author can continue to mint infinite more NFTs of exactly the same thing.

4.  Buying a 'collectible' NFT and the collectible site/host/system goes under/pulls the rug.

5.  Buying an NFT for 'investment', only for that NFT to have an exorbitant (50-100%) royalty fee.  Meaning most or all of the proceeds of your investment go to the creator, instead of you, when you re-sell the NFT.

6.  Buying NFT art/etc. and having the url host of the digital media go down, (or they maliciously change it) so your NFT no longer shows what you bought.  ( But at least you still have ownership rights if you didn't get burned on #1/#2 ... )

Okay, enough doom and gloom.

#5.  What are NFTs good for then?

The biggest *real* success story for NFTs right now are systems like TopShot, CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, etc.  Cases where a website/app/game can interact with the NFTs directly to show you your content, as a proof of ownership of that content, enforced by the app/game.  Likewise, NFTs have big potential for game item marketplaces as the company can issue their items with some royalty rate (ex. 1%), and always get a cut of sales if their game (and trade of its items) takes off.

NFTs can also make for good 'proof of attendance'/historical proof type tokens, which is to say, you could be given one for attending a concert as proof you were there.

In the same vein, NFTs are *perfect* for digital ticket sales.  They can't directly be copied/cloned, and even if they're resold on a secondary market, you will get a cut of it.  (At least, as long as the scalpers play within the system, and don't, say, just sell the ETH address that owns the token, or take cash as payment then transfer the token for 'free'.)

As far as ownership of real unbound digital assets, or physical objects, there is certainly interesting *potential* there, but right now, they're legally useless.

It's also worth noting there's a little more nuance into interesting things NFTs can do in terms of smart-contract-esque stuff that's a little too technical for this post, but might show up in future use cases for them.

Oh, yeah, they're also great for *money laundering*, since if you're buying some nonsense collectable picture of a hat on the internet, it's impossible to say you 'overpayed', so that's a thing.

# Closing Thoughts

I think that about covers NFTs, and *hopefully* this post keeps at least one person from getting scammed.  NFTs *are* a really cool technology with a lot of potential, but when I see people asking crazy questions in the daily about them, it's become clear that they're really selling on hype and a total lack of understanding so far, sadly.

Many of us have been in the same situation in 2017 as the one we are in now. Four years ago I was checking prices every 5 minutes, imagining and calculating how big my future imaginary gains would be. Some nights when prices skyrocketed I literally couldn't sleep properly. Other nights I was worried about not selling the evening before, wondering how much the market will fall while I sleep.

If you are in this for the long-term, don't do this to yourself. Honestly, it is okay to be interested in crypto, read about it, discuss it, etc.

But being obsessed with it, constantly checking prices, calculating future profits is not a healthy thing to do. It consumes a great proportion of your time and energy, and it's basically an emotional rollercoaster.

This metric is also reason why the major institutions and banks have recently started dabbling in cryptocurrency.

What I Wish I'd Known Before Investing in Crypto...,3113,n2w64j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n2w64j/what_i_wish_id_known_before_investing_in_crypto/,584,1619947444.0," Here are a few gems I learned the hard way... sorry about the frustrating Reddit Formatting.


1. Do Your Own Research.  Don't just pick a coin shilled by some clown like me on Reddit or an advisor on YouTube. Your Uncle Tommy might not be as smart as you think. Do read and research to find a project that makes sense and has a real world use cases - good tokenomics and development teams. This leads to...   


2. There are *NO* GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES! 
              ☆Thus, stay away from S***Coins!☆

The Reddit groups such as Satoshi Street Bets and Crypto Moon Shots are not your friend. Anything guaranteeing a 100x -1000x profit is a crook, and rug pulls are common by these developers. This is why people on this Reddit sub get so frustated by people who can't see the dangers of meme coins with no use cases. Most of these coins have less chance of winning than the lottery in your state.   

3. Make your portfolio strong. This means putting more $ in original, safer coins such as BTC and ETH, with much lower percentages in Alt coins such as VET, ADA, DOT, ALGO, and the like. The alt coins carry higher chances of gains, but also much higher risk of losses. You do want to diversify for risk management.  

The older you are, the more conservative you may want to be.  Many people like the strategy of profiting on their smaller coins and putting the profits back into BTC and ETH. My personal strategy is 70:20:10 with 10% in Alts. 

4. Spend only what you can afford to lose.  I know people are sick of hearing this...but I remember stories from 2017 of people taking out 2nd mortgages and selling cars to buy Crypto. Their finances were Rekt very quickly. Right now during this bull market, we all are happy. This can change overnight.   

5. Don't FOMO ( fear of missing out) into a coin. If it's nearly at its high, It can *and* will likely consolidate and go down; you can always buy in at the dip in price. Be patient. This leads to:  

6. Use DCA. Dollar Cost Averaging has been shown by experts to be the best trading strategy in crypto. DCA means buying coins on a regular schedule, hopefully lowering your average costs over time.  You can also DCA/buy the dips, but you never know when a crypto is at a low, so pure DCA usually works better.    

7. Don't PANIC SELL!  This is usually the first mistake newbies make in order to cut their losses.  I know I did.  Had I never panic sold, I would be up about 70% higher than I am today.  
This panic selling also happens in a bear market,  when losses can hit 30% in day. Everyone wants to sell at the same time.  
When you are in doubt about your coin's recent dive,  zoom out on the price chart to look at a year or 2, and you will realize most 20% dips come right back up.    

8. Hold on to your coins,  especially if you bought them because you believe in their future. You will make more money Holding than selling and buying another Crypto almost EVERY TIME.  HODL! 

9. Invest in a hardware wallet when you can. You can keep coins on exchanges or ""hot"" (online) wallets when actively trading, but take the crypto out when you can for safety.  Some exchanges do not give you a seed phrase: many say ""Not your keys, Not your Coin.""  

10. Have an exit plan.  Some people take out their original investment and play only with the house money. Others take profits when a coin reaches a certain % gain or value. Set a goal and use it. If you wait until the bear market you may not have profits to take.   

11. Leverage trading is for idiots fools and you can lose much more then simple investing.  Wait until you're 75, and if you are still alive and heavily in the market -  then maybe leverage trade.   

12. Don't watch your phone or computer all the damn time.  Unless you're a successful day trader (less than .05% of people, experts say) you don't need to watch prices but 2 or 3 times a day. What you find should not change your strategy, unless BTC drops to 10k and you want to buy in. Stress kills.   

13.  It's just money.  A high percentage of people in Crypto just want to get a lift out of poverty and gain some savings. A little money can mean a lot to some of us. But money is not worth your health,  family,  career,  or life. 

Good luck and Make Money!",2021-05-02 04:24:04

There’s currently a huge problem with people who don’t own coins, a lot of them agree that they’re not invested because it’s “fake” money with no actual use. So, we as crypto-owners want to **demand** the right to use the gains we’ve made to purchase real goods.

Now, we’re starting the hashtag #PayWithCrypto. We’re demanding our favorite companies like amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc, to let us pay with cryptocurrency!

*Decentralized?
Bitmain and a small group of big miners control mining in almost all ASIC minable coins. NiceHash offers criminals the ability to attack smaller coins attempting to have more decentralized gpu mining. Non minable coins by their creation aren't decentralized. Sorry they may not be scams but they are definitely not decentralized

*Leaders in the community acting like wallstreet dicks? 
I have to read Charlie praising Tapjets a company that rents fucking private jets, for their crypto payment implementation. Ver doesn't need explaining.  The rest going to NYC and partying at $2000 a head conventions.....Da fuck?

*Rampant market manipulation?
Ok crypto may have been built on this but its blatantly systematic now! The hope of institutional money coming in was to help legitimize crypto markets..... foreseeable backfire there.

*Community that values ""the tech"" over lambos?
Many from the early community cashed out during the boom and were replaced by get rich hopers. Trying to have a conversation with some people on something thats wrong besides Charts and Price is getting harder and harder.

- I clearly highlighted to them the risks and rewards of investing and the best investment is to invest in the tech of the coin by doing the right research first, that doesn't matter though since all they are seeing is the price NOW and all coins are down now. 
- I explicitly told them to avoid some scam coins such as bitconnect (and they did so thats good) but again it doesn't matter now since everything is down, the scam coins with the good coins. 
- No I don't expect people to thank me for introducing them to crypto, I only mentioned this part to highlight how they only remembered me when the market dipped. 
- I learned the lesson the hard way, so fuck me sideways if I ever try to talk about crypto to anyone else IRL again 
- Yes I believe the whole market will bounce back soon, do your own research on why crypto was created in the first place. 
- I won't recommend any coins here in this post because the point of this post is not shilling, please do your own research and decide 
- Remember, you only lose / profit when sell, all the numbers you see in your portfolio apps are just that, numbers. 


Original Post:

Mid November I started talking about crypto with my family and friends and gave them a little ""push"" to start investing small amounts to experiment... I wanted them to make some money because I know they could really use it and I explained how volatile the market rn and the rewards and risk they would have to take and strongly advised them to never ever invest what they can't afford to lose

Some of them got really invested and saw some big gains and started to show off their percentage gains on social media (which is stupid but whatever). 

Noone really thanked me for introducing them to crypto when they made some big gains, they all acted like they got into it because they were smart (before I introduced them to crypto they thought bitcoin was a physical golden coin and can't be bought in fraction), but again whatever I didn't do it for people to thank me I just wanted them to make some money because I know they needed some. 

Fast forward to today morning and FUCK.MY.LIFE I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it's just a correction and don't sell but they aren't listening most of them sold and ""cut their loses"" before the ""bubble burst"".

I am never going to talk about crypto with anyone in real life again, fuck em I am not getting involved in this shitty situation ever again",2018-01-17 12:55:54

I will continue to invest in cryptocurrency to the degree that I believe it has potential, and if it does, the worst decision I can make right now is stopping. I will be much, much more careful with exchanges in the future.

I've been trying to withdraw for a month, but their 10 BTC/day limit screwed me. I was verified quite early and had to pull out small amounts at a time for a very long time. Eventually, their 10 BTC/day limit tended toward something like 1 BTC, and my support tickets weren't answered.

This policy of allowing memes only on the weekend was adopted because the previous policy of only allowing two meme/COMEDY posts in the top 50 during the week and five meme/COMEDY posts on the weekend was prone to being gamed, and was a constant source of frustration for users who felt (fairly or unfairly) that the memes that did make it into the top 50 and stick didn't deserve to be there soaking up karma while their own precious creation was removed by a bot.

This proposal would disallow all simple image and gif posts in /r/CryptoCurrency. We would still allow COMEDY flaired posts in the main sub, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/luu7pa/english_is_outdated/), and those posts would be subject to the proposal that recently passed limiting karma to COMEDY flaired posts. However, direct link to an image, images, or gif would not be allowed to be posted in this subreddit.

Of course, we don't want to kill all memes (well maybe some mods do, but not all of us), so what we are proposing is to shift all memery to our sister subreddit /r/CryptoCurrencyMemes. In the immediate term the plan is to reward the top five meme posts in terms of upvotes that sub has at the end of each week UTC time with MOONs from the mod/community pot in the amount of 400, 250, 150, 100, 50 MOONs. In the medium term, let's say a month or two, we are hoping that we can define a way for these rewards to come directly from the monthly MOON distribution. We have had some preliminary discussion about this with admins and they seem onboard but would like to see the community define a distribution governance proposal and pass it to define exactly how this would be done.

People spout about which coin is hot. AAVE, COMP, ETH...is defi hot? Are nfts hot??? 

So here we have Biden suggesting a cap gains increase and everyone panic sells and rants about missing Trump. 

Do you realize how dumb you sound? Do you even realize that you are literally investing in the very solution to that problem? Did you even know what DeFi stands for or was it just a picture of a unicorn that got your attention?

Defi stands for DECENTRALIZED FINANCE. It means you have a bank, a lender, etc without a middleman. Bankless! And there are CeFi platforms as well that make it even easier!

What do these platforms do, you ask? (Since apparently none of you even bother to understand what you buy. You just cry and scream at the sky when number go down) 

Well, one thing you can do with lending platforms is use your crypto as collateral to take out loans against your crypto! 

and guess what the BEST part is...

...wait for it...

IT ISNT A TAXABLE EVENT. 

Yes. Let me repeat this again. You can have a bIg ole pile of crypto earning rewards and you can take out cash whenever you want and you dont pay taxes on it! And its lower fees than a bank and with defi even lower! Thats literally what you have been investing in the entire time you dolts!! 

It isnt called defi for no reason. Its DECENTRALIZED FINANCE! You can take out loans, earn interest, lend money across the planet. Biden cant touch it if you dont sell it. 

But if everyone PANIC SELLS than that fucks it up for everyone and for the people the angriest at Biden IT FUCKS IT UP FOR YOU THE MOST! 

This isnt wall street bets. This isnt a couch you are buying to flip. The goal is to stack crypto and take out loans against it (which is not a taxable event) or to escape your country’s shitty and predatory banking system! Thats why we are all here!  Its literally what the fucking sub is named. Look up in the top corner of your screen. It says CryptoCurrency! Read thag again a few more times. 

You arent hurting Biden by panic selling, you clowns! You are shooting yourself in the foot. 

Go watch some videos and educate yourself on taxes in crypto and how to avoid them. You can start a crypto IRA. You can simply stack on celsius/nexo/blockfi and take out low interest loans. 

ITS SURREAL TO WATCH THIS! 

Its like watching people investing in canoes and freaking out because their street is flooded and they are like “Well what the fuck are we supposed to do with all these canoes now?!!!”

This is like an IQ test that America failed. Its really sad to watch.

*Edit # 1: For the people saying I am being patronizing and angry. That was the point of the post! Look at all the learning going on in the comments. People are discovering research/google/youtube/websites that explain everything for the first time. Its like watching a caged bird fly! Im tearing up over here! 🥂🦅🕊🕊🕊🕊

*Edit # 2: This post wasnt made to claim that you will never pay taxes on any of your crypto profits. You absolutely will. (If you live in America) Staking rewards are taxed as well as things like Coinbase Earn but i I dont think you need to be worried about Biden’s tax proposal on your Coinbase Earn rewards you big whale you!! I figured this was self explanatory but apparently not.

*Edit # 3: Im not suggesting people take out high risk loans on their crypto to buy a pet ferret. Please learn to read!

*Edit # 4: Cefi loans are not taxable events. Defi loans can be. Thank you for people pointing this out. I am humbled.

BSC is an Ethereum clone and all they did to reduce fees was increase the gas limit. That means that more transactions can be processed for lower fees but it requires more powerful hardware and thus more centralization. Ethereum could do this in 10 minutes if they thought that was beneficial to the network but they haven't because doing so would break a lot of the decentralization and security of the network.

Ethereum is so widely used and trusted **because** it is so decentralized and secure.

Ethereum has the most developers and researchers working on it than any other blockchain project by a very long way which means it is literally the bleeding edge of crypto tech. The Eth killers have a long way to go to knock it off as king of DeFi.

That's not to say that ADA and DOT aren't very promising projects but putting BSC/BNB in with them is almost laughable. It's just a clone! It will always be behind.

Bank asked me to have a talk on crypto,2906,8ir9xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ir9xg/bank_asked_me_to_have_a_talk_on_crypto/,507,1526101923.0,"Today I went to my local RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) branch to open a new account chequing account and mentioned during that process that I would probably use it to fund crypto purchases. Big mistake there (or so I thought).

Essentially the worker there told me that it's their policy that they don't allow cryptocurrency activity and that I wouldn't be allowed to open an account with them unless I guaranteed that I wouldn't be doing that. 

I asked to speak to the branch manager, not expecting to change their mind on the decision but more for an explanation. and she told me it's a huge fraud risk and money laundering issue for them and for that reason they have been taking action against accounts that have activity from exchanges.

Hearing this I went on a mini rant about how exchanges have started following KYC and AML regulations, crypto is a technical marvel, blah blah blah, pretty much no different than the shilling that goes on here.

Apparently she was so impressed that she asked for my contact details and now she wants me do to a 15 minute talk + Q&A session with her and her colleagues discussing cryptocurrency. I actually said yes cause I saw an opportunity for a job down the line lol but here lies my problem. 

Clearly I know more than her about it but I definitely don't know enough about crypto to do a detailed talk and feel confident answering questions. I'm only a year 2 finance student IDK jack shit about anything in this industry. 

Please help me prepare talking points or show me resources I can use to get a more in depth knowledge on this so I don't look like a jackass talking about moons and lambos lmfao

At the time, I couldn't imagine how to get out of this situation and decided to go all in into crypto.

Thanks to A LOT OF WORK obviously, a few successful trades, airdrops and especially the daily reading of the Reddit forums (which made me keep hope in the Long Winter), I managed to settle the last debt a few weeks ago.

I was inspired by the post from the guy who became a millionaire thanks to crypto, and I'd like to celebrate this little victory with you too!

Now it's time to start accumulating again! Once more, thank you!

EDIT: Some updates answering most asked questions:

&#x200B;

1. Yeah, I paid the taxes.
2. About jumping out in a bull market:

I know, but I couldn't wait any longer... the bank I owed wouldn't open a checking account that became necessary because of a business contract. I have 2 employees depending on this contract. =\]

3. Some highlights of these 3 years:

Please, this is not a financial advice.

I started reading a lot about BTC and other top10 coins. Invested in some alts because, for me back in 2017, BTC was also too high at 10-20k.

So, I picked up coins with a good product/idea and company/team behind it. Examples are: IOTA, XRP (at least in my first readings), XMR. Because I joined in quite early, I didn't lose money with XRP, for example, but I did with IOTA (because of the timing).

In the bear market, I put some money in BTC as well -- monthly, yeah. Then, started to look for microcap projects, such as BOMB, Parachute token, Uptrennd, XIO etc. Making part of these microcap communities is a good way to make some extra and know some good people. Of course, be very aware of scams.

Today, I wish I could have done some things different:

1. Don't fall in love with an asset (and sell or exchange them for profit);
2. Bitcoin is the most resillient coin around, so it would be much less stressful if I had more BTC instead of alts;
3. Don't be too greedy and profit all over the bullrun;
4. DCA is the best strategy, as most of you pointed out;
5. Don't hodl when the bear market starts (these were the longest 3 years in my life lol). I would sell everything back in Q1 2018 to return months or years later.

Thanks for your kind words. And yes,  this is why we crypto!",2021-01-12 15:58:24

The retail investor community has the memory and logic of a literal goldfish.,2897,c657ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/c657ly/the_retail_investor_community_has_the_memory_and/,553,1561669098.0,"It has been just under three years since I've joined the subreddit, and just over three years since I started being interested in cryptocurrency. After countless hours of research on the various industries being disrupted, after reading whitepapers, parsing through the profile of team members, watching recorded conferences and making calculations based on demand and market size, I can write with full confidence that the overwhelming majority of the community of crypto investors is retarded. Never have I seen a market that is less focused on growth objectives, or that circlejerks harder to news and announcements whose impact they don't even try to measure or fully understand.

In all honesty, it's not *that* surprising. The tech itself is more or less difficult to understand (anyone with an engineering, computer science, economics or finance background *should* be able to grasp the underlying concepts and realize why distributed ledgers have vale, despite not being familiar with every key concept) but the extremely hard part is picturing exactly how efficiencies are bound to be created on an industrial level, and how impactful they will be. In other markets, this is why there exist ratings, panels of experts, consulting groups. They perpetually gauge the health of various industries and make predictions based on trends, to help others make informed decisions. Even then, a layer of speculation (and thus, manipulation) always exists, but the ratio of speculation vs. real demand tends to be in a different league entirely.

Despite knowing or suspecting this, however, the same shit happens **every time** here. Bitcoin starts to drop, and the trolls come out of the woods to spread their depressive thoughts onto everyone else. Altcoins start to shine, and the morons who bought during the frenzy and are seeing 10% gains for the first time in weeks, months, if not ever, start tugging each other and patting themselves in the back and writing essays as to why DPoS experiment #898 (which doesn't even have a main net yet) is on track to being massively adopted and is *definitely* the best buy opportunity of the decade. Bitcoin starts to rise again, and suddenly all money floods from the rest of the market to feed Big Daddy and every single other project is a shitcoin again and they'll never amount to anything ever.

It is beyond frustrating to see how easily everyone is being manipulated. Short-term fluctuations in the market doesn't make you right, and it doesn't make you wrong either. There are basically *zero* candid discussions on the state of the technology and ***how it stands relative to adoption.*** There are basically *zero* attempts to map out the ecosystem in a comprehensive way so that 'investors' can have a clear picture of how some projects might interact with each other, allowing us to formulate enlightened guesses as to how much market share each might capture. Nobody seems to give a shit about decentralization *at all*, but I suspect for the vast majority, it was never about freedom and fairness, only profits.

Everybody strictly only celebrates when the market moves up without ever questioning the validity of that movement. When an asset inflates without any fundamental reason, its only achievement is the creation of a bubble that will inevitably result in severe losses for the majority of investors. 

With the size of this community (this subreddit alone), we have the power to warn others and to influence the market by infusing some rationality into it. So please, take the time to encourage others to look beyond immediate gains and to research the field. Take the time to criticize twitter ""influencers"". Take the time to reach out to professors, industry professionals and other knowledgeable experts to ask them their thoughts about specific projects and the market as a whole. We desperately need to create a global stage on which there is informed discourse, else this market will never truly grow.",2019-06-27 15:58:18

**\_\_\_**

This hack happened on October 14, 2018. I woke up early in the morning my local time. Right away I turned on the laptop and checked my inbox where I discovered the abnormally large volume of letters from the COSS Exchange. There were a few thousands of them. Each letter informed me about a failed attempt to enter my account on the Exchange.

[https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V](https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V)

I received all of the e-mails when I slept. I rushed to check the account and discovered that all my holdings were gone. More specifically, they were sold on low-liquid markets at the rates substantially lower than the market ones.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f](https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f)

In no time I turned to the support of the Exchange and informed about the incident. I wrote about this situation on Reddit and in the public Telegram group of the Exchange. Naturally, the first reaction that I experienced from the community was humiliation and accusations of stupidity. Many called me a dumb fool because I stored funds on the Exchange and so on. No need to point out how I kept the funds. I have what I have now. So on a weekly basis, the Exchange shares the trading fees with the holders of its tokens. The profit is distributed among token holders proportionally to the number of tokens they possess. That's why I decided to keep my tokens with COSS exchange.

The exchange claims:

[https://medium.com/@coss.io/coss-io-october-24th-2018-updates-180ca2bb003b](https://medium.com/@coss.io/coss-io-october-24th-2018-updates-180ca2bb003b)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/bXFU7D1CQamFzrZpi8TRskjqsiW1C2](https://monosnap.com/file/bXFU7D1CQamFzrZpi8TRskjqsiW1C2)

They forgot to mention one small fact that access to my account was received using vulnerability which allowed hacker to perform brute force attack on my 2FA.

I was not the only victim as COSS declares in their medium blog and hacker indeed used exchange’s vulnerability:  
[https://monosnap.com/file/X48I4OrgYBgw5vAORRQLJtrcved06l](https://monosnap.com/file/X48I4OrgYBgw5vAORRQLJtrcved06l)  
COSS Exchange was under DDOS + Brute force attack

They’ve shut down an entire exchange for \~24 hours:  
[https://monosnap.com/file/7AHQbzugClSxUwlx2lHFIpadtxhiqv](https://monosnap.com/file/7AHQbzugClSxUwlx2lHFIpadtxhiqv)

What was that if not an exchange’s vulnerability?

The Exchange claims that the hacker had my password. Of course, the most natural and the easiest thing is to accuse the user of being responsible for the accident. But I can assure you that it is far from being the case. I have been in this industry since the end of 2011, and I do know how to generate and store wallets, passwords etc. I neither use Android smartphones, nor computers with Windows OS. I do not use SMS 2FA. I am meticulous and do not do bullshit. What if it was some internal job? Or users data base leaked? Ok, let's assume that I happened to become a victim/target of a hacker, who somehow managed to access my login and password (what I doubt A LOT). However, I had a 2FA verification installed for this occasion.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V](https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V)

It was designed exactly for the situations like the one I described above. 2FA enables to keep the funds safe even if the password/login was compromised. Recently I received a report from COSS compliance, in which they admitted that the brute force attack took place. After 25,000 trials the attack was successfully completed.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO](https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO)

The hacker got the access to my account and sold all my funds for nothing. After all the Exchange ignores my messages about refund and steps towards that. They’ve only stated amount of assets they were able to recover and  
[https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO](https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO)

claiming that it was the user's (mine) fault that the hacker managed to access the funds.[https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV](https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV)

How come? How would the hacker have accessed the funds if the Exchange had not allowed to perform the brute force attack? Even if it was me who had compromised the password in some magic way, 2FA had to serve the last stand. The hacker managed to brute force it using Exchange’s vulnerability and the Exchange has not stopped the brute force attack. Remember, there were 25,000 trials  
[https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa](https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa)

If I had additional time, I would manage to respond and prevent the hack. Even if there was my fault, but only 50%, the other half is that exchange gave the opportunity to the hacker to brute force 2FA. In this regard, I publicly call the COSS Exchange to refund me at least 50% of my account's balance.

Assets I had:

\~11 700 000 coss tokens (30kk$ at ATH period)

\~14 BTC

19 000 eos to refund in full (EOS node was down and hacker wasn’t able to withdraw EOS)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ](https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ)

\~ 22 ETH

The Exchange should bear the sole responsibility for the accident if its internal vulnerability allowed the hacker to accomplish his/her brute force attack.

If it would be possible to bypass 2FA protection with a brute force attack, every exchange/platform, as well as 2FA providers (generally Google), would be brought into disrepute and would face severe claims from their users. Basically, the whole industry would become a mess. If the case, exchanges/platforms would suffer multi-billion dollar losses, in particular, translating into even more significant losses for the industry as a whole.

No matter what decision COSS exchange will take I call other exchanges to add an extra security feature to protect user’s funds. TRADING PASSWORD. This will prevent anybody to sell user’s assets on the low liquidity markets for cents even if the password was compromised and exchange grants brute force attacks.

I’m not promoting anybody, just facts:

I paid off my house today,2821,jof3la,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jof3la/i_paid_off_my_house_today/,466,1604592618.0,"My life changed because of one silly post that I came across on reddit. It was a pic of someone holding up their paper wallet from a bitcoin atm showing both public and private keys. The picture made me wonder if there were any nearby bitcoin atms, so I did a quick google search and found an atm 20 minutes away from me. I went to the atm and put in 50$ just to say that I had some bitcoin. I signed up for /r/bitcoinbeginners and learned about Coinbase. After signing up with Coinbase, I started researching the ""other"" crypto being offered and learned about /r/cryptocurrency. I started buying eth at 8$ and eventually invested 30% of my net worth in crypto. 

I stuck with eth during lows & highs and yes I do regret sometimes not selling at top during last bull run. This month I decided that I wanted to set a baseline on what I would get with my crypto investment. I sold enough eth and bitcoin to pay off the mortgage to my house and compensate for taxes. Today I went to the bank and turned in my final house payment. No matter what happens to crypto from here on out, I have a house. Paying off the house was never a goal for 2020. Hell, it wasn't even a goal for the next decade.

Do I think ETH will hit above $1400 again? Yes, and it might happen next week or next year or half a decade. I've never doubted the technology. However, getting rid of my mortgage takes an immediate, priceless weight off my shoulders. I work in an industry where layoffs always seem to be on the horizon, and it's hard to get a job when everyone is out of a job. Now I don't have to worry about keeping a roof over my family's head. The relief is euphoric.

I'm not completely off the crypto ride. I still have a good amount of eth left. I'm going to invest a small amount per month back into eth and bitcoin to slowly build my stockpile back up, but I'm not in any rush. I'd like to thank this sub as well as many others for all the knowledge, advice, and entertainment.

TLDR - Paid off my house with cryptocurrency gains. Financial freedom is something everyone deserves.",2020-11-05 10:10:18

A guide to replacing your full time job with Reddit MOONs,2770,my5mdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my5mdk/a_guide_to_replacing_your_full_time_job_with/,813,1619375441.0,"this is in no way shape or form a good idea, just thought i'd post this here because it's 6am and im doing fucking math on reddit crypto lmao.

&#x200B;

Anyways, right now a moon is worth about 8 cents. If you wanted to replace your full time job with raking in moons on reddit, it would take a lot of time and effort but here we go.

The average hourly wage in the USA is \~$15. This means that at that wage you are making about 31,000 dollars a year. Now, going off of the math of 1 upvote = 0.48 moons (credit to /u/pkg322 because i saw that on one of their comments.), this means that 1 upvote is just under 4 cents.

Now, your yearly wage of 31,000 dollars divided by 8 cents (1 moon) means that you would need to acquire a total of 387,500 moons per year in order to sustainably replace your full time job. This is also equivalent to...

\- 32,291.67 moons per MONTH

\- 1061.64 moons per DAY

\- 44.24 moons per HOUR

&#x200B;

This also means that you need \~90 upvotes per hour to replace your full time job.

have fun with this knowledge bois

EDIT: I have learned there is a cap of 15k moons per month per account, this is still equivalent to $1.2k per month. Pretty pog.

Update: haha, 30 upvotes in the past hour.. that's like a whole moon.. my ploy to become the greatest moon farmer is coming to fruition!

Update 2: ok for real y'all are making me rich out here, also thanks for the awards friends!

Update for everyone saying ""you have to farm 24 hours a day this is stupid"": You only need to post a few good posts and then people can upvote it at any time... It doesn't just disappear lol",2021-04-25 13:30:41

I own a barbershop in U.K and I have now started to accept cryptocurrency as payments for haircuts. I have been doing this for years now but on and off, I always wanted to make it known to all customers that this is possible with the right cryptocurrencies. At the moment I am accepting only NANO due to its speed and fees compared to other cryptos. I use NANO's official app and the customers who would like to pay in crypto know about it. For other currencies like BTC, ADA, ETH etc.. I will be using my wallets like Atomic, Trust and or exchanges like [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) & Coinbase. 

I have around 8 customers right now that pay only in crypto and hopefully there will be more. I charge £15 for a haircut but if you pay in crypto I lower it to £12. I have posters made for the shop so that when we re-open on 12th April all customers can see and hopefully start to look into investing and using crypto themselves. Bitcoin has changed my life, I bought my business and home because of it so I am always going to be a big fan.

Understanding Tether: Why it accounts for a substantial part of the crypto market cap and why its the #1 outstanding issue in crypto markets today,2695,7xae98,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7xae98/understanding_tether_why_it_accounts_for_a/,706,1518566749.0,"In this post I will go in-depth on:

1. How Tether got to be what it is today

2. Why Tether's market cap is a lot more than 0.5% of the total market cap for crypto you see on CoinMarketCap

3. Tether printing timing

4. Tether reserves

5. What could happen to the market if Tether is found to not be backed by reserves

Tether is incredibly important to the cryptocurrency market ecosystem and I've noticed far too few people understand what is going on. 

Very little actual discussion of the 2nd biggest crypto by volume happens here and whenever someone starts a discussion they most often got slapped for ""FUD"". Tether themselves recently hired the major New York based PR firm 5W to spread positive information online and take down critics, I'm sure some of their operatives are probably on Reddit.

But its absolutely critical you understand the risks behind Tether and especially now with the explosion in reserve liability, breakdown in relationship with banks and their auditor and recently announced subpoena. 


#What exactly is Tether and what happened so far?

Tether is a cryptocurrency asset issued by Tether Limited (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a sister company of Bitfinex), on top of the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omni Protocol Layer. It is meant to give people a ""stablecoin"", for example a merchant who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Recently they've also added an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Tether Ltd claims that each one of the tokens issued is backed by actual US dollar (and more recently Euro) reserves. The idea is that when a business partner deposits US dollars in Tether’s bank account, Tether creates a matching amount of tokens and transfers them to that partner, it is NOT a fractional reserve system.

Tether makes the two following key promises in its whitepaper on which the entire premise is build:

> Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one USDTether equals
one dollar).

>Professional auditors will regularly verify, sign, and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement.

Tether is centralized and dependent on your trust of Bitfinex/Tether Limited, and that the people behind it are honest people. For the new entrants to this market it will be greatly beneficial understand the timeline of Tether and their connection to Bitfinex.

A brief timeline:

* Bitfinex operators Phil Potter and CFO Giancarlo Devasini set up Tether Limited in the British Virgin Islands, but told the public that Bitfinex and Tether are completely separate. Throughout 2015 and 2016, the amount of Tether stays relatively flat.

* In August 2nd, 2016, the second-largest digital currency exchange heist in history happened, when Bitfinex lost nearly 120,000 bitcoin. Bitfinex never revealed full details of the hack, but BitGo (the security company that had to sign off on the transactions) claims its servers were not breached.  

* Just 4 days after the hack Bitfinex “socializes” its losses from the theft by announcing a 36 percent haircut for almost all of its customers. In return, customers receive BFX tokens, initially valued at $1 each. 

* Two weeks after the hack Bitfinex announces it has hired Ledger Labs, to investigate the theft and perform a financial audit of its cryptocurrency and fiat assets. The public nevers sees the results of the investigation, and months later, Bitfinex admits it never actually hired Ledger Labs to perform an audit to begin with.   

* In May 2017, after long standing calls for an actual audit, Bitfinex hires Friedman LLP to ""complete a comprehensive balance sheet audit.""

* November 7, 2017: Leaked documents dubbed “Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals.

* November 19, 2017: Tether is hacked, with 31 million USDT suddenly disappearing. Tether Limited reacts to this by creating a hard fork.

* December 4, 2017: Right after hiring the PR firm 5W to help improve their image, Bitfinex hires law firm Steptoe & Johnson and threatens legal action against critics.

* December 6, 2017 - CFTC issues a subpoena to Tether and Bitfinex. This news isn't made public until the end of January. 

* December 21, 2017 : Without making any formal announcement, Bitfinex appears to suddenly close all new account registrations. Those trying to register for a new account are asked for a mysterious referral code, but no referral code seems to exist.

* After a month of being closed to new registrations, Bitfinex announces it is reopening its doors, but now requires new customers to deposit $10,000 before they can begin trading.

* Friedman LLP completely cut ties with Tether on January 27, 2017.

#Most common misconception: Tether is only a small part of the total market cap

One of the most common misconception people have about cryptocurrencies is that the ""market cap"" amount they see on CoinMarketCap.com is actually the amount of money that is invested in each coin. 

I often hear people online dismiss any issue with tether by simply claiming its not big enough to cause any effect, saying ""Well Tether is only $2.2 billion on CoinMarketCap and the market is 400 billion, its only 0.5% of the market"". 


But this misunderstands what market capitalization for cryptocurrency is, and just how different the market cap for Tether is to every other token. The market cap is simply the last trade price times the circulating supply. It doesn't take into account the order book depth at all. The majority of Bitcoin (and most coins) are held by those who either mined or purchased for a very low price early on and simply held on as very small portions of the total supply was rapidly bid up to their current price.

An increase in market cap of X does NOT represent an inflow of X dollars invested, not even close. A 400 billion dollar market cap for crypto does NOT mean that there is 400 billion dollars underwriting the assets. Meanwhile a 2 billion dollar Tether market cap means there should be exactly $2 billion backing up the asset.

Nobody can tell for sure exactly how much money has been invested in cryptocurrency market, but [analysts from JPMorgan](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) found that there was only net inflow of $6 billion fiat that resulted in $300 billion market cap at the time. This gives us a roughly 50:1 ratio of market cap to fiat inflow.  Prominent crypto evangelist Julian Hosp [gives the following estimate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-why-market-capitalisation-is-a-bad-way-to-measure-a-cryptocurrencys-value-2018-1): ""For a cryptocurrency to have a market cap of $1 billion, maybe only $50 million actually moved into the cryptocurrency.""

For Tether however the market cap is simply the outstanding supply, 2.2 billion USDT is actually equal to 2.2 billion USD. In order to get $50 USDT you have to deposit $50 real U.S. dollars and then 50 completely new tokens will be issued, which never existed before on the market.

What is also often ignored is that Bitfinex allows margin trading, at a 3.3x leverage. Bitfinexed did an excellent analysis on how tether is entering Bitfinex to fund margin positions

There are $2.2 billion in Tether outstanding and the current market cap of the entire market is $400 billion according to CoinMarketCap. You can actually calculate Tether as a % of total fiat invested in the market according to the JP Morgan estimate, the following table outlines for a scenario of no margin lending and 15/25% of tether being on a 3.3x leverage margin account:

Fiat Inflow/Market Cap Ratio | Tether as % of total market (no margin) | Tether as % of total market (15% on margin) | Tether as % of total market (25% on margin) 
----------|----------------|----------------|----------------
JP Morgan estimate (50:1) | 27.5 % | 36.9 % | 43.3 %

Even without any margin lending Tether is underwriting the worth of about 27.5% of the cryptocurrency market, and if we assume only 25% was leveraged out at 3.3x on margin we have a whole 43% of the market cap being driven by Tether inflow.

A much better indicator on CoinMarketCap of just how influential Tether is actually the volume, i[ts currently the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency by volume](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour) and there are even days where its volume exceeds its market cap. 

What this all means is that not only is the market cap for cryptocurrencies drastically overestimating the amount of actual fiat capital that is underwriting those assets, but a **substantial portion of the entire market cap is being derived from the value of Tether's market cap rather than real money**.

Its incredibly important that more new investors realize that Tether isn't a side issue or a minor cog in the machine, but one of the core underlying mechanisms on which the entire market worth is built. **Ensuring that whoever controls this stablecoin is honest and transparent is absolutely critical to the health of the market.**

#Two main concerns with Tether

The primary concerns with Tether can be split into two categories:

1. Tether issuance timing - Does Tether Ltd issue USDT organically or is it timed to stop downward selling pressure? 

2. Reserves - Does Tether Ltd actually have the fiat reserves at a 1:1 ratio, and why is there still no audit or third party guarantee of this?


#Does Tether print USDT to prop up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In the last 3 months the amount of USDT has nearly quadrupled, with nearly a billion being printed in January alone. Some people have found the timing of the most recent batch of Tether as highly suspect because it seemed to coincide with Bitcoin's price being propped up. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html

This was recently analyzed statistically: 

>Author’s opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.

>Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet. 

>Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.

https://www.tetherreport.com

I'm still undecided on this and I would love to see more statistical analysis done, because the price of Bitcoin is so volatile while Tether printing only happens in large batches. Simply looking at the Bitcoin price graph over the last 3 months and then the Tether printing its pretty clear there is a relationship but it doesn't seem to hold over longer periods.

Ultimately to me this timing isn't that much of an issue, as long Tether is backed by US dollars. If Bitfinex was timing the prints then it accounts to not much more than an organized pumping scheme, which isn't a fundamental problem. The much more serious concern is whether those buy order are being conducted on the faith of fictitious  dollars that don't exist, regardless of when those buy orders occur.


#Didn't Tether release an audit in September?

Some online posters have recently tried to spread the notion that Tether has actually been audited by Friedman LLP and that a report was released in September 2017. That was actually just a consulting engagement, which you can read here:

https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf

They clearly state that:

>This engagement does not contemplate tests of accounting records or the performance of other procedures performed in an audit or attest engagement. Our procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance...In addition, our services do not include determination of compliance with laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 

They state right from the beginning that this is a consultancy job (not an audit), and that its not meant to be assurance to third parties. Doing a consultancy job is just doing a task asked by your customer. In a consultancy job you take information as true from the client, and you have no mandate to verify whether your customer's claims are true or not. The way they checked is simply asking Tether to provide them the information:

>All inquiries made through the consulting process have been directed towards, and the data obtained from, the Client and personnel responsible for maintaining such information.

Tether provided a screenshots of twp bank balances. One of these is in the name of Tether Limited, and while the other is a personal account of an individual who Tether Limited claims has a trust agreement with them:

>As of September 15, 2017, the bank held $60,919,810 in **an account in the name of an in individual for the benefit of Tether Limited**. FLPP obtained an engagement letter for an interim settlement plan between that individual and Tether Limited and that **according to Tether Limited, is the relevant agreement with the trustee. FLLP did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representation about its legality.**

Even worse is that later on in Note 1, they clearly claim that there is no actual evidence that this engagement letter or trust has any legal merit:

>**Note 1: FLLP makes no representations about sufficiency or enforceability of any trust agreement between the trustee and the Client**

Essentially what this is saying is that the trust agreement may not even be worth the paper it’s printed on. 

And most importantly… Note 2:

>“**FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions**”

Basically Tether gave them a name of an individual with $60 million in their account according to a screenshot, Tether then gave them a letter saying that there is a trust agreement between this individual and Tether Limited. They also have account with $382 million but no guarantee that this account holds to any lien or other commitments, or that it can be accessed. 

Currently Tether has 2.2 billion USDT outstanding and we have absolutely no idea whether this is actually backed by anything, and the long promised audit is still outstanding.


# What happens if its revealed that Tether doesn't have its US dollar reserves?

According to Thomas Glucksmann, head of business development at Gatecoin: ""If a tether debacle unfolds, it will likely cause quite a devastating ripple effect across many of the exchanges that see most of their volumes traded against the supposedly USD-backed cryptocurrency.""

According to Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley: ""You could see a spike in prices in tether-only bitcoin exchanges. So, on those exchanges only you will see a run up in price compared to the bitcoin exchanges that actually work with actually money. So you would see a huge price diverge as people see that only way they can turn tether into real money is to buy other cryptocurrency then move to another exchange. That is a bank run.""

I definitely see the crypto equivalent of a bank run, as people actually try to secure their gains an realize that this money doesn't actually exist within the system:

> If traders lose confidence in it and its value starts to drop, “people will run for the door,” says Carlson, the former Wall Street trader. If Tether can’t meet all its customers’ demand for dollars (and its Terms of Service suggest that in many cases it won’t even try), tether holders will try to snap up other cryptocurrencies instead, temporarily causing prices for those currencies to soar. With tether’s role as an inter-exchange facilitator compromised, investors might lose faith in cryptocurrencies more generally. “At the end of the day, people would be losing substantial sums, and in the long term this would be very bad for cryptocurrencies,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor and co-director of its Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

>Another concern is that Bitfinex might simply shut down, pocketing the bitcoins it has allegedly been stockpiling. Because people who trade on Bitfinex allow the exchange to hold their money while they speculate, these traders could face substantial losses. “The exchanges are like unregulated banks and could run off with everyone’s money,” says Tony Arcieri, a former Square employee turned entrepreneur trying to build a legally regulated exchange.

https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/

The way I see it, this would be how it plays out if Tether collapses:

1. Tether-enabled exchanges will see a massive spike in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices as everyone leaves Tether. Noobs in these exchanges will think they are now millionaires until they realize they are rich in tethers but poor in dollars.

2. Exchanges that have not integrated Tether will experienced large drops in Bitcoin and alts as experienced investors flee crypto into USD. 

3. There will be a flight of Bitcoin from Tether-integrated exchanges to non-Tether exchanges with fiat off-ramps. Exchanges running small fractional reserves will be exposed, further increasing calls for greater reserves requirements.

4. The exchanges might slam the doors shut on withdrawals.

5. Many exchanges that own large balances of Tether, especially Bitfinex, will likely become insolvent. 

6. There will be lawsuits flying everywhere and with Tether Limited being incorporated on a Carribean Island whose solvency and bankruptcy laws will likely ensure they don't ever get much back. This could take years and potentially push away new investors from entering the space.

#Conclusion

We can't be 100% completely sure that Tether is a scam, but its so laiden with red flags that at this point I would call it the biggest systematic risk in the crypto space. Its bigger than any nation's potential regulatory steps because it cuts right into the issue of trust across the entire ecosystem.

Ultimately Tether is centralizing one of the very core mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets and asking you to trust one party to be the safekeeper, and I really see very little reason to trust Bitfinex given their history of lying and screwing over their own customers. I think that Tether initially started as a legit business to facilitate the ease of moving money and avoiding regulations, but somewhere along the lines greed and/or incompetence took over (something that seems common with Bitfinex's previous actions). Right now we're playing proverbial hot potato, and as long as people believe that Tether is worth a dollar everything is fine, but as some point the Emperor will have to step out from hiding and somebody will point out they have no clothes.

In the long term I really hope once Tether collapses we can move on and get the following two implemented which would greatly improve the market for all investors:

1. Actual USD fiat pairings on the major exchanges for the major currencies

2. Regulatory rules on exchange reserve requirements 

I had watched the Bitconnect people insist for the last 2 years that everything about Bitconnect made perfect sense because they were getting paid daily. The scam works until one day it suddenly doesn't. 

Tether could still come clean and avoid all of this ""FUD"" by simply getting a simple review of their banking, they don't even need a full audit. If everything was legit with Tether, it would be incredibly easy to have a segregated bank account with the funds used solely to back up Tether, then have an third party accounting firm simply review the account and a bank reconciliation statement then spend a few hours in contact with the bank to ensure no outstanding liabilities are held on that balance. This is extremely basic stuff, it would take a few hours to set up and wouldn't take a lot of man-hours for a qualified account to do, and yet they don’t do it. Why? Why hire a major PR firm and spend god knows how much money to pay professional PR representatives to attack ""FUD"" online instead?

I think I know why.

Robinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.

If you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. 

After that you can start thinking about buying cryptocurrencies. You can purchase cryptocurrencies from several popular exchanges/platforms such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase. You can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there. You should note that there will often be a transaction or a 'gas fee' when moving most crypto's off an exchange and into your wallet which depending on how much of a crypto you own might not make it worth it to move off an exchange.

Heads up boys: We're on the brink of something massive.,2561,8gz9wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8gz9wc/heads_up_boys_were_on_the_brink_of_something/,881,1525469653.0,"Sup guys,  

I just want to give everyone a heads up that shits about the get real in so many ways and YOU are here early.  Yes, you, the guy that bought in December and thinks you'll never recover from all your losses.

Let's go over a few of the things we know about.

1.  The top talent in the world are leaving their old tech/finance jobs and entering blockchain.  Everywhere you look, we're seeing this.  From hedge fund managers, to JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs execs, to Google execs.  Gee golly, why are the most talented and intelligent people in the world entering crypto? 

2.  Banks are diving balls deep into crypto (mostly behind the scenes).  First the banks ignored crypto, then they laughed at crypto, then they attacked it by calling it a ""scam.""  Now they're acquiring exchanges (Poloniex), about to open trading desks, investing in projects (Digital Currency Group), and are in a race to get in before their competitors.

3.  Custodial Services: I cannot overstate the importance of this.  As I've written before, Coinbase is going to be at the forefront of mass adoption and are going to play a key role in all of this.  They've recently been hiring INSANE amounts of management positions, engineers, and something around 500 new customer service reps.  This is because they're about to roll out their custodial program where every credit union and some participating major banks are going to offer their crypto index fund to their customers.  Baby boomer (and Gen X) Mom n Dad are going to walk into their local credit union to talk to their financial advisor and he's going to offer them a new product that is extremely volatile, however, got a return of about 1000% last year. He's going to suggest 2-5% of their portfolio would be ok to invest and these coins are going to be insured; They will never have to trade for crypto or make accounts on sketchy exchanges to get them, just gets their broker to buy them like any other financial product.

4.  The demand for OTC crypto is insane.  This is why you see Gemini and Coinbase starting their own Bloc trading services.  Who and why is there so much OTC demand?

5.  Liquidity is about to blow up.  If you don't understand what liquidity does for markets/coin value, do a bit of research.  The exchange union is coming, where the participating exchanges share liquidity.

6.  Because of this future liquidity, traditional securities (company shares, bonds) and commodities will be represented by crypto.  This one's going to take some time, but you can see the writing on the wall here.  This is going to be where crypto is in full-fledged mass adoption-mode. 


Unfortunately back in December/January crypto wasn't quite ready for the explosion that happened. Exchanges had to freeze trading, not allow new sign-ups, not enough service reps, low security on exchanges, and the tech in general wasn't quite ready but things are changing this year, 2018.  Sit back, open a cold one with the boys, make love to your smokin' hot wife, go play catch outside with your kids, and enjoy yourselves because we're about to witness history - And your all a part of it my friends.  Cheers!

Bittrex wants its own subreddit to be shut down for no reason.,2558,7gwj9n,https://i.redd.it/zqhnheqmic101.png,393,1512178207.0,,2017-12-01 19:30:07
"So I took part in 14 airdrops reportedly worth '$2,827.90'..",2549,kebssy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kebssy/so_i_took_part_in_14_airdrops_reportedly_worth/,247,1608163210.0,"So we’re all aware of the Uniswap airdrop that took place earlier this year, where some lucky folk woke up to over $1200 worth of UNI dropped to them in their wallet – worth over $3,000 at its peak – simply for interacting with the Uniswap platform prior September 1st 2020. I wasn’t one of these fortunate few and neither were a lot of other people here. I’d see people asking if they were too late for the airdrop, or if there were any other airdrops similar. This gave me an idea:- take part in as many airdrops as possible and see how many had any value to them and report back. The answer may seem obvious to some, but I wanted to evidence it. 

The task was simple, enter ‘cryptocurrency airdrops’ into a search engine and see what came up. This eventually led me to joining several airdrop telegrams and twitter accounts and after a week or so I had applied for 14 airdrop by mid October. 

These projects almost universally required the user to join the project’s telegram group as well as like and retweet a post on the project’s twitter account and follow them. Some would ask you to join their Facebook or Medium page and some would require you to post about them and tag friends in. Needless to say, I used throwaway accounts and didn't take part in any that required to tag someone else. Nearly all of them touted themselves as the next big thing in decentralized finance. These were the projects and what they advertised:

**Name**|**Airdrop**|**Adv. $ value**
:--|:--:|:--:
ArbiSwap | 1000 Aswap | $30
UniSwapx | 500 UNIX | $500
Imperium PB | 100 IPBA | $50
YFIV Finance | 1 YFIV | $360
CryptoTechGiants | 50 USDT | $50
Universe Token | 500 UNIT | $500
yToken Finance | 0.2 YTKN | $4
CeliSwap | 500 CSP | $500
XUNII.Finance | 200 XUNII | $20
Revo Finance | 1.5 RVF | $28.90
Ybull Finance | 0.2 YBULL | $10
YFDiamond | 1 YFD | $25
Xenon Token | 5000 XNT | $50
dEarn Finance | 70 DFI | $700

Now, those of you who have been here a while will know exactly where this thread is going. To others, this should confirm their suspicions. Telegram is abbreviated to 'TG'.

**Name**|**Received**|**What Happened**
:--|:--:|:--
ArbiSwap | 0 Aswap | You had to pay them $2 for gas to get airdrop worth $1.34 (worth $1.11 as of now)
UniSwapx | 0 UNIX | **Airdrop never arrived**, locked their TG whilst heavily pushing presale
Imperium PB | 0 IPBA | **Airdrop never arrived**, Telegram channel locked 2 days before airdrop
YFIV Finance | 0 YFIV | **Airdrop never arrived** but still heavily pushing presale even now
CryptoTechGiants | 0 USDT | Airdrop turned into a competition based on how many people you could refer, TG channel turned into a *signal group* (A.K.A P&D group)
Universe Token | 0 UNIT | **Airdrop never arrived**. Locked their TG and advertised a doubling ETH scam website to their users
yToken Finance | 0 YTKN | **Airdrop never arrived**. TG locked and then sold to 'BinanceSwap'
CeliSwap | 0 CSP | TG locked. Required 0.09 ETH (then $45) to be sent which ""they would send back""
XUNII.Finance | 0 XUNII | **Airdrop never arrived**. TG locked and now advertises other 'airdrops'
Revo Finance | 0 RVF | **Airdrop never arrived** due to ""high gas fees"". No one bought their presale so they created a poll asking why. Still pushing presale
Ybull Finance | 0 YBULL | **Airdrop never arrived**. Locked and ghosted their TG channel before airdrop
YFDiamond | **0.00005 YFD** | They airdropped 0.00005 YFD out of the 1 YFD advertised. TG locked and now advertises other 'airdrops'
Xenon Token | 0 XNT | **Airdrop never arrived**. Deleted their TG channel 
dEarn Finance | 0 DFI | You had to send 0.05 ETH ($25) to them first to 'validate' your address

So. out of a combined **$2,827.90** worth of cryptocurrencies advertised to be airdropped, only one 'project' actually airdropped anything and that was 0.005% of what was advertised which is currently worthless. 

This wasn't a surprise to myself and I am glad to have the actual data to back up my suspicions. 

**FINDINGS:**

 - Based on the Telegram channels of these 'projects', most of the users were from South America and the Middle East. Presumably from impoverished countries trying to find themselves some income.  
 - These 'airdrops' were almost always a front to peddle a presale of their token. This appears to be the primary goal of most of them. They want to sell their newly-minted tokens for ETH, promising their project will get listed on big exchanges 'Soon™'.
 - I only had to provide an email to one project: ArbiSwap. I used a throwaway email. After a couple of weeks I started to receive unsolicited emails from unrelated projects. This indicates that they shared/sold information of their users to other 'projects'.
 - Some of the Telegram channels have been renamed and wiped of all information. The dEarn has been labelled a scam by Telegram themselves. Another has wiped all info and has renamed itself 'Project for Sale' and have made one post stating ""We couldn't raise enough from presale, so we abandon the project"". I am unable to find out which 'project' this channel belonged to. 
 - Some projects seem to work together and promote the other project to their users on TG and twitter. 
 - Airdrop twitter accounts and telegrams don't always promote the same airdrops, indicating that they only advertise airdrops that they're paid to advertise by the 'project'. 

**To any newcomers to the cryptosphere, please do your research before taking part in any airdrops. Your time is worth more than most of these 'projects' combined. If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.**",2020-12-16 18:00:10
Crypto changed my life,2546,8dl4po,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8dl4po/crypto_changed_my_life/,330,1524229588.0,"First off, this isn’t another “I put in 10$ in bitcoin in 2010 and bought a house today” thread.

Crypto has changed my life in a completely different way…it has made me hungry for knowledge. Cyber, networking, blockchain knowledge.

I use to find myself sitting at my computer desk reading random articles from random websites about every single random blockchain that caught my attention. I would invest in a project.... make a little money, then switch to another project... lose a little money. 

I’m not going to lie…I don’t have what it takes to be a day trader…lesson learned.

However, I kept finding myself hungry for more knowledge. I wanted to know everything about everything.

Finally, one day I was staring at my computer….basically broke and feeling slightly depressed due to a downturn in the market….and decided to do something about it. My old ass went back to school. 

Now I’m proud to say, 4 years later, I have recently finished my Bachelors in Cyber Security, Comptia Sec+ and A+ certs and I even finished up my Associates from when I was 18 and dropped out my final semester. Dumb…I know. But I personally know I would have never decided to take this path without crypto influencing me. 

Next time you find yourself staring at coinmarketcap and the price of your coins, try to find what aspects of these coins excite you (other than the lambos) THEN GO LEARN. See if this is your passion. You don’t even have to go to college. You can find hundreds of learning resources online. Go better yourself and help this community grow.

If crypto somehow implodes tomorrow, will you have anything to show for all the time you have spent staring at your computer/phone screen? Or will it all be screenshots, memories, and what could have beens?

Verge is a shitcoin.

What problem does it solve better than any of the top 10, what is it's purpose, and why is it worth what it is worth?

If you can't answer these questions honestly, then it is in fact... a shitcoin.

Now, besides all that, the coin was literally hacked last week, and the price of it was actually still going up... in a fucking bear market. Now come on, even if you jerk off to this coin, and spread its greatness all around the interwebs, even you have to admit that it's a bit fucking suspicious right?

Then, the sole developer, living in his moms basement, allegedly, with a bit too much hair on his neck, allegedly, has the ball to tell his community, that he will release news on the ""biggest partnership in cryptocurrency history"" if... you give him millions of dollars.... to pay his taxes... allegedly.

And then he goes ahead, and changes the big announcement date to the 17th of April, which so happens to be the exact day all United States taxes are due... coincidence?

I mean I wish I was making this shit up people, but are people really this fucking dumb, or is the developer actually being trolled himself, and these so called investors are actually just 4Channers waiting to pump and dump this thing like nothing ever seen before?

That's the only explanation I could come up with, that or the whole thing is being manipulated by team McAfee, hence the original push... what say you guys?",2018-04-08 16:20:18

Market cycles are a long-term price pattern used when technically analysing price of cryptocurrencies, stocks or fiat currencies. The theory of market cycles is incredibly prevalent in cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin's price succinctly completing a full cycle no less than five times in its ten year history. During a cycle, some securities or asset classes outperform others because their business models aligned with conditions for growth


**•Don't chase hype.** [ Avoid FOMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kt6a4h/fomo_traps_to_avoid_beginner_guide_with/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) (fear of missing out) traps. Don't believe everyone who is shilling a coin. Always remember the adage: “If the shoe shine boys are giving financial advice, then it’s time to get out of the market."" Practice DD (Due diligence). Don't ever chase a coin that's gone up so much. Never consider a  miss out on potential profits as loss. Always do your own research (DYOR).


**•The market is not always like this.** Right now, it's a very volatile and bullish market. A lot of all these gains you see are not normal.


**•Please only invest money you are willing to lose.** Don't take out a loan, use rent money or other funds you can't afford to lose. No, seriously, there literally can't be any reasons to ever go against this rule. Ever! Only. Invest. What. You. Can. Afford. to. Loose.


**•Low cap coins, lets say anything not in the top 50 by circulating market cap, come and go like the wind.** These projects rarely stay around, they often can’t launch products, and most die a slow death on exchanges as founders and early investors dump them to zero drying up any liquidity that is there. Becareful with them and do a very thorough research before investing in anyone for the long term. Again, always DYOR.


•**Absolutely don't touch margin trading/leverage/futures/options unless you are a pro at all of the above.** Otherwise stay put in the relatively simpler world of spot trading.


**•Don't ever feel bad for for investing with small amounts, any amount is good; it will help you to learn.** No one cares if you've invested $100 or $1m. What matters is that you've taken a step for your future self, from which most of people are disconnected. No, this is no joke. [FMRI studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51738840_Future_self-continuity_How_conceptions_of_the_future_self_transform_intertemporal_choice) suggest that when you imagine your future self, your brain does something weird: It stops acting as if you’re thinking about yourself. Instead, it starts acting as if you’re thinking about a completely different person. So when you make plans for your future by investing even just a small amount in crypto, you've successfully broken that barrier and actively planned on your own behalf to create a better world and a better life for your future self. No one should make you feel anything but proud of this.


**•Your goal in long term investments are the high cap coins.** The top 30, 20, or more preferably top 10 that have been around for a while. Or other altcoins whose projects you've done diligent research on and truly believe they'll grow immensely and contribute to the crypto sphere and tech in general.

Trust me, greed and high-risk will not help you recoup your losses.


**•Whatever low experience, always remember there are thousands of skilled traders out there today who've experienced the same and even worse.** Trust me, you'll recover. 


**•Never place all your trust on Technical analysis alone.** They can disappoint you like that highschool friend that always never stood up for you especially when the bullies (whales) showed up to deal with you. They're also almost pure horseshit when dealing with low cap coins.


**•Understand [basic trade psychology](https://www.google.com/amp/s/academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-psychology-of-market-cycles.amp)**, especially during uptrends and downtrends. And always keep an eye out for potential cognitive biases like confirmation bias, loss aversion, endowment effect and others that may greatly influence your decision making. 


**•If you're not willing or ready to commit yourself to a lifetime of learning, you shouldn't be trading or investing in cryptocurrencies.**

So why don’t we start by just chuckling at funny posts or even replying with ‘haha’ without upvoting them. We have the power to upvote and reward interesting discussions, well written DD and real crypto news instead of memes, monologues and more memes.

Let’s welcome new investors with knowledge, information and discussions that actually improve the cryptosphere. Because in the end, we all want to moon together. 🚀🌖

&#x200B;

The tribalism is a big problem and will get us nowhere. I don't go around downvoting posts for mentioning coins that aren't in my portfolio... seems like I'm the last guy around that thinks that way.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

Wow, I did not expect this simple post to resonate with so many people and cause this much discussion. This is a good thing, it shows many of us acknowledge this problem. I also was not trying to single out Vechain or Nano, or delegitimize those projects, they are just the first two offenders that came to mind. I know there are many more cryptocurrency communities that the same can be said for but I won't name names, because that isn't the point of this post.

&#x200B;

Let's do something about this. Don't be that guy/girl, don't downvote a post simply because it references a coin that you don't own or a project that directly competes against one of your big holdings. I get it, the same amount of coins that you hold today are worth maybe 10% of the value that it was in early 2018. I also get that you probably consolidated most of your losses into a few projects, maybe even just one that you are the most confident can come back. Cool, good for you, I hope it works out. But don't censor posts simply because they go against an agenda of pumping your bags. It makes us all look bad and no one just coming into this space is going to want to stick around if this is what they are greeted with. Let's try and learn something new  instead of shouting as loud as we can about our coins and silencing those that disagree with us. This is an exciting time to be alive, we can't allow tunnel vision to get in the way of the big picture here. We are all still early, there is still so much to learn and so much to gain from being in this space right now.",2018-11-13 23:21:28

"This isn't a ""dip."" It's a giant liquidity suck.",2478,kuvpyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kuvpyk/this_isnt_a_dip_its_a_giant_liquidity_suck/,1146,1610370134.0,"tl;dr version: The dips are market manipulations by institutional players. Don't panic sell, and think carefully about where you set your stop-losses at least until the $100K mark. 

So I keep seeing people compare this bullrun to 2013 or 2017. But they're wrong. Unlike the inherently speculative nature of the previous runs, this is an accumulative run driven by institutions and high-wealth individuals. They think and act differently, and you need to know the difference.

You may have noticed a pattern of late that an ATH is reached, and then it immediately pulls back significantly. I see people putting it down to ""corrections"" or ""dips"" that you normally see but it's not. It's an intentional market manipulation by those big players.

The problem that they're running into is that there simply isn't enough BTC on the market at any given time to satisfy the needs of the institutions themselves and the clients they serve. They have to find ways to pump liquidity into the market, so this is what they're doing. 

They don't care about short-term trading losses. They're dumping large amounts of BTC in the form of BTC and derivatives to drive down the prices and trigger stop-losses and panic selling. BTC that would otherwise be safely locked up are being released onto the market, and they're snapping them up at (relatively) bargain basement prices.

Then what happens afterward? They've now sucked all the possible liquidity out of the market. It's gone. Everyone they can possibly induce to sell has sold. Which leaves only those waiting for higher prices to sell. And so we hit a new ATH, rinse and repeat.

So how will we be able to tell when it's a real ""dip"" or ""correction."" They've already told us. JPMorgan says their target is $146K. Citi says $300K. And if players like JPM and Citi have set targets, you can bet the others have too. We just don't know where they are. A safe bet is somewhere in between those two numbers.

JPM probably won't wait for $146K to stop buying, and Citi's not going to wait for $300K. If I had to place a guess, I'd say somewhere that would leave them at least a 10% gain (which would be better than an average year investing in the S&P500). That places JPM's # somewhere around $130K and Citi at $270K. Until we're safely past $100K at the very least, they're not going to stop. Continue on with your HODLing no matter what kind of gyrations they put the market through.",2021-01-11 07:02:14

Basically you earn moons from Karma once a month but there is a few things that determine how much you will earn.

Edit: Forgot the most important part! If you are on the reddit app go to your profile and activate the Moon vault! 

Iirc you can only do it on the app and you have 6 months to claim your moons in the vault.

Post Karma - Each upvote/downvote has 1 karma, unless it is a meme or media, then it is 10%.


Comment Karma - Each comment upvote/downvote gets 2 karma since the there was a proposal to make comments give 2x karma that passed.


Karma limit - limit of 1000 karma per post or comment.

When do you get the moons? - Moons are distributed every 4 weeks 

What is the current ratio? - The ratio normaly get lower each month for an example last one was 0.42 which means 1 Karma equals to 0.42 moons, the one before that was 0.52 and the one before that was 0.87.


Proposal regarding moons that got accepted.


20% bonus : If you don't move out your moons, you get +20% on next 
distribution.


5% voting bonus : This one is passed but not official yet. If you vote on proposals, you'll get +5% on next distribution.

Posts with the comedy flair only get 10% of the Karma earned from that post.

You can also look up moons on Coingecko ( https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon ) 

To see how much they are worth and where they are listed, and the total supply of moons that will be released (out of 250m around 60m is 'released')

Edit: The ratio is dynamic and don't necessary have to get lower but considering it went lower the last 5-6  month i assume it will continue get lower.

Edit 2: Apperently a few cant see/activate their vault and some nice fella posted this 

'Should also note; you'll have to get the official reddit app (gross) and then also navigate to the vault page manually and enable it in your browser. If you don't, the vault option *will not appear in the app.* It was really confusing when I had to set it up and my friends were telling me 'just go to the vault option in the reddit app lol'. '

Bitboy “promoting” shitcoins for easy profits leaving newcomers with massive loses,2380,lvnub7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lvnub7/bitboy_promoting_shitcoins_for_easy_profits/,689,1614669820.0,"Bitboy is the biggest crypto youtuber right now with almost 600K subscribers.

Today he uploaded a video where he recommended 4 different coins. One of those was a low cap coin called Nord Finance (NORD). In just 3 hours the coin has risen 50% probably leaving him with massive profits.

He has done this numerous times and will probably keep doing so. There’s no way he’s not holding big amount of coins like these himself for easy profits after pumping them. 

Videos “promoting” coins like this made by such big names are extremely bad for the crypto space. Especially newcomers who will buy the top and get rekt in a few days when it dumps. 

What he’s doing is such unethical considering his massive fanbase mainly consisting of beginners. I feel like not enough people are talking about this and taking to account the effects.

How and why exchanges are manipulating the price in order to capitalize on the new market dynamics,2364,8aymhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8aymhw/how_and_why_exchanges_are_manipulating_the_price/,482,1523311262.0,"The current market seems to be largely driven not by organic buying and selling, but by exchange driven manipulation of the spot market to exploit the current dynamics of leverage trading. We just saw it again now as they liquidated 3K longs but you [can see this pattern of clear manipulation over and over in the last few weeks ](https://i.imgur.com/LpgnksQ.png).

We have seen several forces set an incentive for exchanges to do this:

* Consistently declining volume - this leads to lower total fee revenue for exchanges, and an incentive to manipulate the price in order to earn revenue through liquidations rather than trading fees.

* Move towards more leveraged positions - both leveraged shorts and leveraged longs are [at or near record levels.](https://i.imgur.com/ljSohM5.png) Shorts especially have gone from 8K outstanding in January to 33K right now, a whole tripling in outstanding positions. 

* Move away from the spot market and towards derivatives - Anybody who has been checking [the combined orderbook](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD) over the last few months has seen Bitmex completely take over the market, while GDAX, Bitfinex, Gemini and others see consistent declines. I've noticed myself an increased interest across the Internet on how derivatives work and anecdotely I have seen more people move away from the HODL meme and towards trading taking high margin bets with a portion of their stack.

Some exchanges like Gemini have reacted to all of this by increasing their trading fees by 400%. Meanwhile Bitfinex specifically seems to be using its hefty weight to manipulate the price in order to capitalize on the record number of people using margin to bet. 

Both longs and shorts are bets on the price moving up or down and they have a ""liquidation price"" at which they get liquidated by the exchange, essentially the exchange gets the entire stack they bet with and extracts a high market fee multiplied by the leverage. Since the exchanges know the characteristics of the outstanding shorts/longs, and since volume is low after these pumps or dumps leading to sideways drift, they can essentially engineer movements in price that create income in terms of liquidations. When there are lots of overleveraged shorts, an exchange can pump the price with bots briefly and collect the short position. Same with longs but in reverse, a quick burst of selling pressure.

You can see this in the most recent pumps too on Bitfinex, where 1K buy orders appear out of nowhere after long sideways movement only to be followed by either sideway movement or slow bleed on pathetic volume:

https://i.imgur.com/3YaWVBI.png

https://i.imgur.com/pvpcd7Z.png

Take a look at the most recent pump up to 7K, it instantanously liquidated about 700 short positions:

https://i.imgur.com/3sCLEB8.png

Now this last dump was a laddered 12.5K sell order on Bitfinex that liquidated around 3K long contracts

https://i.imgur.com/znYyUT8.png

Bitfinex tends to be where the big money traders move (their minimum deposit is 10K) so even if each long position was only 0.5 BTC on average they exchange would make a ton of money. If you look at the BitmexRekt twitter feed that shows a running list of Bitmex liquidations with humorous commetary, [you will see many >$1 million dollar positions being liquidated during these moves.](https://i.imgur.com/fbeJxOT.png)

This is what all the ""Bart"" formations we have seen stem from. Its not George Soros pumping Bitcoin for shits and giggles, nor is it the nebolous ""whales"". They have no incentive to try and pull off PnDs now that it only leads to either sideways movement or decline after the pump. A PnD only works if the delta between the top of the pump end point and dump initiation point is positive, while now it seems to be followed by sideways movement. Those who do want to bet on further upward movements seem to be doing it off the spot market, using margin with futures and perpetuity swaps on Bitmex. This makes the low volume spot market ripe for manipulation, exchanges like Bitfinex and Bitmex have every incentive right now to manipulate the price. 

Looking back it seems almost inevitable that this would have happened, that traders would try to replicate the gains they saw by buying and selling on the spot market a few months ago by using increased leverage and derivatives. In December and January there were days where your holdings would increase by at least 20% no matter what you bought. Once you experience those 20% daily gains you don't want to go back to a market where it slowly bleeds down a few percent every week, so people jumped in on high leverage short positions to multiply their profit on those single percent moves down.

For the small time investor there really isn't much you can do to stop this. This is what being part of an unregulated market means, it means that things like wash trading and long/short liquidation hunting is allowed. 

All you can really do if you're a trader is look at the current ratio of longs vs shorts on Bitfinex and be aware that once short contracts become too high its possible that an exchange may pump the price to profit on it, while if the longs become too dominant we may see a dump.

Edit: Bitfinex, not Bitfenix.

Cryptocurrencies saved my granddad's life.,2322,7klp9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7klp9q/cryptocurrencies_saved_my_granddads_life/,240,1513638015.0,"I'm your basic 25 years old 9-5 employee making an average salary in Ireland. Few months ago I was browsing the net and came across a website (bittrex) that offers cryptocurrency trading, so I did my research and few days later, exactly on 25. June 2017 I bought my first 0.25btc (around 500e back then) and started trading. Ethereum, antshares, litecoin, stratis, waves and so on and so on, I lost few $ on shilled coins but I gained much more on ICOs and altcoin trading.

After few months I was looking at a portfolio of over 5000e without any further investment mostly achieved by the rocket moon of bitcoin and just by doing some turnarounds and daily trades. That was in September 30th and on that day my grandfather has been diagnosed with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in an early stage where his right side of lungs is affected by a tumour. We're originally from Slovakia so the only option to get this treated was to undergo a surgery to remove the tumour, but considering how bad is the Slovakian healthcare we weren't willing to go forward with this procedure(only procedure covered by his healthcare). The only option was to privately pay for a treatment abroad. After a very long search we found a private clinic that could help us, Oncology clinic in Prague, which was costly but they had the best surgeons to help us.

Few days passed and we received a quote for the treatment. Where the fuck are we going to get 7900e was the next question that went through my mind, my grandparents are on absolutely hilarious Slovakian pension of 420e/month and there was no way they could afford this. My mother couldn't help because her financial situation wasn't any better and then it struck me...Let's take the profits from crypto and use it to pay for the surgery and that's exactly what I did. I cashed out all my crypto and ended up with 6300e on my bank account. Flew to Prague to undergo the initial examination and few weeks later, on 17th of November my granddad had a surgery where the whole right side of his lungs had to be removed due to the spread of the tumour. His weight dropped to 62kg(-18kg in less than two months) and he was having horrendous pains because of the ribs that had to be snapped to access the lungs during the surgery. Everything went good and there were no complications during or after the surgery.

As of today, 18th of December, less than 4 months after he has been diagnosed we received the final results of his progress and cancer stage. No cancerous cells were find anywhere in his body, his lungs are working great, no liver damage and he's now at hom, regaining weight and strenght, all well and healthy, looking forward to spend another few healthy years with his family and loved ones. I know that this fight is probably not over yet as cancer will most likely return at one point, but for now we won and all of this thanks to cryptomarket, without crypto we wouldn't be able to afford this surgery and give him another few years of life to enjoy.",2017-12-18 17:00:15

1. When BTC Dominance increases, alts on the whole lose BTC value.
2. When BTC Dominance decreases, alts on the whole gain BTC value.

In the 2008 stock market crash, the S&P 500 went back to the value it had 10 YEARS ago. 

Crypto has been set back 23 days. 

An equivalent 23-day setback on the stock market would mean a drop of about 3%. Can you imagine the news freaking out about a 3% drop? 

I see nothing to worry about, just normal fluctuations in a healthy (but volatile) market. I bet in a few months the market cap will be back to where it was. What can be done and undone in 23 days can  be redone again in 23 days. There's too much overall momentum toward cryptos, even if a 23-day bubble is popping. It's not a 10-year bubble. This is the thing people have to realize. 

Let's imagine, even if (worst case) the whole crypto market cut in half _again_ on top of where we are now, we'd only be set back to late November, about 50 days ago. Internet money is simply useful, and that's not going to change. And we're clearly still at the front(ish) end of the mass adoption curve. These two things are the bedrock of the investment in to cryptocurrencies, and those things haven't changed. 

If you were to panic sell now, I'm guessing in about a couple months you will be regretting it. Almost certainly in a few years you will be regretting it. Imagine cryptos going up another 1000% (which it has, more than once over the years) and you sold because you got cold feet after a 20% movement. A 23-day bubble is not worth being emotional about if you're a long-term investor, which is generally the smartest and lowest-risk way to invest. 

Plus we have no way of knowing how much of this is just one whale getting in and out of the market to create profitable price swings. That can (and probably will) happen again. 

The ocean isn't draining because we're at the low point of a big wave. There will be other waves, and other high points. It's just a matter of patience. As long as the two bedrock principles of why to invest in crypto are still in place (people want internet money, and we are in early adoption phase) I see no reason to sell. ",2018-01-17 03:52:24

Hi everyone.

I have posted this previously - however there was a few issues which I have now fixed.

1. Changed to Coingecko api. This now supports the top 1000 cryptocurrencies.
2. Loads much faster.
3. Should work internationally . The last version had formatting issues which caused errors for some people depending on their region settings. This should now work without having to change your excel language settings. Its difficult for me to test this in all the countries so please let me know if you are getting equation errors related to the exchange rate conversions.

This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself gradually over a few years. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my crypto holdings (good for tax purposes). No need to trust third party apps to keep your personal information - track it yourself.

There is a lot in here;

Automatically updates prices from coingecko. The top 1000 coins included. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the ticker symbol.

You can choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any fiat currency.

I don't record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purchases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time (it logs this data every time you save the sheet)

"I have another one for you guys, I coded a Binance trading algorithm that analyses the news sentiment from the top 100 crypto feeds and makes buying decisions, and of course - it's open source",2299,msu5qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/msu5qw/i_have_another_one_for_you_guys_i_coded_a_binance/,412,1618706577.0,"I had a lot of fun building this algo, and I'm quite happy with how it turned out! It's probably my most complex trading algorithm yet, and I'm happy to share it with this community because you reacted so nicely to my other projects!

Here's quick overview of what the bot does:

1. Pulls and analyzes the last headline from the top 100 crypto news sites
2. Provide an overview on the most mentioned coin across all the headlines
3. Analyse the sentiment of each headline and categorises the output by coin
4. Places a Buy order if the compound sentiment is positive and the a coin is mentioned in multiple headlines
5. It works with any cryptocurrency available on Binance

Here are some considerations that I am planning address in the future:

1. I accidentally used Feedspospot's top 100 Bitcoin feeds, so the sources are a bit biased right now
2. During my testing the compound sentiment wasn't high enough and wouldn't place a lot of trades
3. It can probably make use of multiprocessing to increase performance

Anyway, here is the GitHub repo for the source code: [https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-News-Sentiment-Bot](https://github.com/CyberPunkMetalHead/Binance-News-Sentiment-Bot)

Are you seriously that naive? Market consolidations are normal you fucking idiots. NOTHING does 2000% + and then just magically finds a fucking base there. 

Everyone crying about the manipulation is just a fuckin hypocrite. You loved making the money that the unregulated market allowed you to make, but you were too dumb and greedy to know when to exit. Cry more fuckin bag holders. The market will come back. Who cares how long that takes because it guaranteed will. The entire crypto cap is still grossly undervalued, but you need MODEST growth in order to be sustainable.

edit: for the people nay-saying that this is definitely a crash - a market needs to be considered stable at its net present value before it can be considered to have crashed. this market has been overbought/overstretched way past the point of being stable in the long term. When your alt coins hit an ATH and then drop 40% but still end up 10x gains on what they were before the run up, you don't call that a crash, you call it a ""healthy correction.""

Here's the thing, I don't know shit, and you don't know shit. So, now that we are both level headed, you and I both agree we are shitbrains that don't know what will happen in the market, let's talk about psychology.

When BTC 2x, 3x or 5x, your little peepee will get tingly. The memes will be flowing, you'll be big dick swinging in your 1 bedroom basement apartment in the ""up and coming"" side of town as you check your crypto portfolio multiple times in the middle of the night while people you used to hang out with are out having a good time playing fortnite or whatever the fuck kids are playing these days.

Despite the fact you've already said that you're ""in this for the long haul,"" you're still checking your portfolio like an instagramer stalks people on their timeline.

Why the fuck are you checking prices every 15 minutes still if you're a long term hodler?

The passed10k.gif will come back out of retirement eventually, and you'll be picking colors for your lambo all from your $100 investment into bitshitnect coin.

Then, it will happen. Nobody knows when, but all it takes is a sudden gush of short term traders to sell and wreck your hard hodl'd gains.

You will rush to your favorite shitposting site and blast to the world, ""I was just up 3x, now BTC is down 50% in the last week! What's going on? It's that damn whale again, isn't it!?""

A few people will tell you to keep hodling, ""This is just the beginning,"" they say. But you're smarter than that. You just held through a 3x gain, then lost 50% of those gains. You'll soon get  your confirmation bias from a couple dipshit redditors, ""Derp, 3x gains ain't nothing to sneeze at. Herp, you should have sold then rebought during this correction and you'd have doubled your stack, hurrrr.""

You'll think, ""Wow, your hindsight is absolutely right. Next time it happens, I'll be prepared and I will predict the market with 100% accuracy. I'll say I'm a long term hodler, but I'll keep checking the prices 20 times a day hoping to perfectly time the top and bottom. I'm a very stable genius.""

Then, BTC will have a small bounce up of 15% the next week. You'll find someone that you agree with on Trading View that tells everyone, ""It's going to go retest the shit support at shit level fibonichi 0.69. The pullout method is upon us, there is a 420% chance I'm right, and .007 chance I'm wrong. I'm not your financial adviser, I'm just a guy shilling my ideas hoping I get enough support to influence the market. No collusion!""

You'll sell, the market will bounce back up another 20%, you'll fomo, the market will tank another 50%. You'll sell at another loss, it will drop another 10% and you'll run to reddit, ""I knew it was going to drop, so I sold! I just made 10% more by selling""...but you didn't actually buy yet because you think it's going to drop a little bit further.

You won't tell people you also just got wrecked your previous 4 times doing this and you're down more than 70% during a bull run because you kept trying to time the market.

Of those that are reading this now, my guess is, **at best**, only 1 out of every 100 people will actually DCA or just hodl through the next bull run.

There are going to be multiple, and I'm talking many month long shakeouts along the way to wherever BTC is going.

I don't think 99% of people have the patience and the will to hodl through the gains and the massive selloffs.

You're here now, you've been through a bear market. But, seeing gains is a much different beast. I suspect that once you deal with the 3rd or 4th major shakeout after 3x, 5x, 6x gains, I'm talking truly massive 50-75% selloffs in a few days, that you won't be able to stomach it for long.

Some have $10,000-$50,000 invested down here. Imagine in a year that you have 2x, 3x, or 5x that. Then, you lose 70% of your gains in a week.

This is a real possibility, multiple times. Whether you have $100, $1000, or $50,000 invested down here during the bear market, you need to prepare for that feeling of getting absolutely wrecked in a week.

Some among us are going to have their $20,000 turn into $80,000 or $100,000, then drop to $30,000 or $25,000 in the next 12-18 months.

Imagine this happening multiple times, this 3-6x then losing 70% of those gains, multiple times in a relatively short period of time. Imagine months long consolidation after a sell off, then another shakeout after you were just wishing you would have sold.

It's nice to look at a chart in hindsight and say, ""Zoom out,"" but going through it is a lot more difficult than just looking at the past history from a chart.

You'll be able to hodl through 1 or 2 selloffs, but at some point you're going to be having a stressful week or a stressful month in the next few years. it's going to coincide with a massive selloff and you're going to be sitting there thinking, ""shit, I would have been better off just selling last time. This shit is too stressful.""

For the record, there is nothing wrong with selling at a 2x, 3x, or 5x or whatever you choose, but I remain extremely skeptical that people will actually hodl all the way to the top or near the top of the next bull market, let alone being able to predict when and where that is. Even fewer among us will DCA all the way through and sell at whatever the next top will be.

This is a cruel game, and you won't make it unscathed. Most will fail because of a lack of planning.

Prove me wrong, fellow hodlers and DCAers.

Prove me fucking wrong.

**TL;DR**: Comment based on the title, otherwise read the shit.

*Edit : For the record, I don't know shit, but I do think the top of the next bull market will be $180,000 to $225,000. I have no idea what happens in between now and then. You don't either. And, again, I don't know that it will actually get there, but my spidey senses tell me that. I'd expect it to be around August 2021 and January 2022 though. In a few years. I'll only have about 50% of my stack by that point because I have certain intervals I'm selling because I know I could be wrong; again, I don't know shit so I'm going to sell as I reach certain targets. I'll be DCAing most of the way through, and I'll see you all in crypto hell regardless, you filthy casuals.*",2019-05-11 15:09:43

2017 Taxes - We Need To Get Serious,2252,7nzqky,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7nzqky/2017_taxes_we_need_to_get_serious/,996,1515060615.0,"I want to make this post a meaningful discussion about American taxes that has three goals:

* **Helping those of us with significant crypto holdings become informed on how to proceed with 2017 taxes**
* **Strengthen our position as legitimate law-abiding citizens**
* **Not holding anyone legally responsible for ""legal advice"" who contributes to this discussion thread** (this is about getting our bearings)

If you are like me you found 2017 to be a very good year for you. I'm not talking to the people who got in on this in early December and made $1,000. I'm talking to those of us who saw our modest yet respectable holding of bitcoins grow to jaw-dropping prices and then continued to diversify our digital portfolio to the point that we may now be holding dozens of currencies traded at various times on a variety of exchanges.

What we are doing is legal and has been legal for years. I am one of those [alleged 802 people who pays their taxes on Coinbase](http://fortune.com/2017/03/19/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit/). And let me tell you, the professional accounting firm I use to pay my taxes charged me a pretty penny for basically knowing the one thing everyone does know about cryptocurrency - that [you have to pay long-term capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies you've held for over a year and sold for American dollars](https://bitcoin.tax/blog/bitcoin-taxes-common-questions/). So that's what I've been doing and I've been doing that with each bitcoin being considered at 100% profit because I bought all my bitcoins from Mt. Gox! Maybe you've never payed taxes on all the bitcoin you sold but let's face it - in 2017 you better pay your taxes and you better know what you're talking about and doing. A lot of us have found ourselves with serious money that we did not have until 2017.

The real problem comes from the variety of exchanges we've joined and the amount of trading of currencies on these exchanges. Many of these exchanges are also not illegal to use. While Bitcoin has been on the IRS radar for a while these exchanges specialize in something that has never been truly significant enough to get the IRS's full attention until 2017. But this problem is multi-faceted:

* **In 2017, was exchanging one crypto for another crypto considered a taxable event?** - [The fact is there isn't a clear answer on this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/12/28/loophole-allows-tax-free-bitcoin-exchanges-into-2018/#4f50d7b312fa). With the IRS tying cryptocurrencies down as property (rather than currencies which- as I understand it- wouldn't be taxed) they allowed the loophole of the 1031 which allows swaps for like-kind properties. The IRS called cryptos properties, people are swapping cryptos with each other (literally) while small fees are charged for using the network or exchange, and thus - it could be argued that all exchanges *between* cryptos are NOT a taxable event. I personally like this idea but I clearly have a bias. There are many other people who claim that all cryptocurrency transactions between each other are taxable and this comes with its own bag of worms. And indeed, the rock-star new Republican tax code does mirror this sentiment by solely claiming 1031 use for Real Estate. So this leaves us with another question:

* **What legal stance should we take when talking with our accountants/ doing our taxes?** The stunning impossibility of what is expected of us LEGAL citizens doing LEGAL trading in order to report on our taxes, if we do take the stance that all crypto transactions are taxable, is so highly complex that it's almost like the IRS is forcing all crypto-traders into an illegal space. In a sense they are trip-wiring the entire crypto market with expectations that are impossible to follow. We must have some legal rights here or at least legal stances that we can take when dealing with such a new fast paced market and such a slowly-responding vaguely-directed bureaucracy like the IRS. In [one of the better crypto tax threads on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m56g0/the_absolute_fucking_impossibility_of_reporting/) one person expressed with acute detail the amount of problems recording all of our transactions really are based on the current IRS expectations which are vague and the IRS is not giving a clear answer on whether cryptos are allowed to be considered exempted using 1031. Even if they were there still is expected a way to report everything. My accountant will want to do whatever is safest for them and likely the most expensive for me. How do I ensure a reasonable approach is taken by my tax professional that considers my needs and not just throwing as much money at the IRS as possible? I want to pay my taxes but I want tax laws to be fair on crypto, which leaves me to my next point:

* **What is the best way to look at crypto from a tax point of view?** Currently cryptocurrency is a square peg in a round hole. The IRS, clearly unprepared (as we all were) for the massive attention and growth of cryptocurrency in 2017 was already stuffed into the the ""property"" hole despite being developed and created for *much more* than that. Cryptocurrency - whether you want to call it an asset or a currency - is already billions of dollars deep in projects that are meant to change the way entire systems operate *on a global scale*! This is a global thing taking place within  different countries. We already pay capital gains taxes or income taxes when we exchange them into dollars which is a fair and easily reliable system to document - is it even right for the IRS to tax more? While there may be some in here who believe nobody should be paying taxes with cryptos I think that cryptos (like everything else) should have some taxable responsibility- but not so much that it becomes highly burdensome and a legal minefield allowing the IRS specter to be chasing you for alleged misdoings years down the line. And if crypto is as successful as its going to be there will likely be less of a reason to exchange into dollars anymore thus losing the leverage of the capital gains/income tax. And looking into the short term future decentralized exchanges are even going to be set up potentially removing the ability to track cryptos in any form whatever! What is the appropriate way to tax crypto basing it on the fact that it IS crypto and not necessarily merely ""property"" or ""currency""?

* **What level of responsibility do exchanges play in 2017 taxes?** Being a proud Coinbase tax payer I had the privilege of giving my tax accountant a printed out piece of paper with a terrible excel sheet on it that displayed my yearly bitcoin transactions and told them that this was the best document they were going to get. I haven't gotten the information from Coinbase this year yet, and hopefully they've improved the quality of the report but  *at least there is one*. I just tried looking for how to get the information from Bittrex and while it may be available it wasn't easy to find with a google-search or on their website. **That** is a problem. This is an exchange that is legally allowed to operate in the United States. I could sign up to Bitcoin.tax to find out the information allegedly but I really should not have to sign up to anywhere to find out how to get my annual tax document from my exchange. And if they don't provide one then why is the United States legally allowing them to operate within their borders? If the IRS decides to take their records two years down the line like they did in 2017 with Coinbase and they come to us asking us why we didn't report something and it was because there was no easy/possible way to obtain the records from the users end, how can that be our fault? It would be great if there was a sticky-noted thread on ANY of these crypto boards on how to obtain a document of the year's transactions from every one of the exchanges out there because many of us need them. There is an expectation that we are supposed to calculate the amount gained from when we first purchased a currency to when we traded it for another currency. Aside from the fact that even if we are provided an annual report document it won't be in dollars - it will be in BTC or ETH or USDT or some other pairing at a specific time with a specific amount in those pairings on that specific exchange. The dollar correlation that's needed - if not provided - makes reporting crypto transactions nearly impossible.

* **How are we supposed to accommodate for transactions to and from wallets?** Say we can do all of those things above but now we move it to a private wallet for safekeeping. From there we might send it to another wallet as it intermingles with other coins and from there they are traded on other exchanges. What is the dollar correlation there? What is the appropriate gains? Which exchange did you buy *that specific coin* from? This all matters for taxes but almost impossible to track between wallets and exchanges. If it can't be done, how can we be held accountable to do it? If we can't do it, then what legal ground do we have to say what is being expected is byzantine and unrealistic? Also, it's my understanding that we don't need to report coins in private wallets but that'll be nearly impossible not to do if we have to do all this tracking.

* **Who specializes in cryptocurrency?** - Maybe we can't find all the answers here but some of you out there must be able to point us in the direction of someone that can give us answers. I'm not talking about the conservative tax lawyer that's going to make sure you pay every last dime in a way that would make the IRS want them to be the new head of the department - and I'm not talking about the shady guy who promises that you can get out of paying a dime. I'm talking professionals that aren't just going to be pushed over and know their stuff on this topic. I will gladly pay for this legal muscle to ensure I am legally participating in our society through crypto transactions while not just trying to tax me every time I click the mouse.

Some people say just to ignore all of this tax mess because the IRS is likely to change their stance 10 more times. But I don't want to ignore it because cryptocurrency is already seen as a shady business. And it's not - it's a globally disruptive technology that provides benefits many centralized systems can't and it's the reason why it's busting through the $700 billion market cap at the beginning of 2018. Please, let's organize and approach our taxes honestly and in an informed fashion this year. The fact is many of us in the crypto community visit crypto subreddits and together - with a similar mentality, attitude, drive, and direction- we can influence the crypto policy to be fair to both the country and the crypto-trader.

Innovations start and flourish in America.
==========
When they (the banks and recent crackdown on customers) fear you, they try to suppress you. But wait, innovation always wins.

Highlights from tomorrow's testimony from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman-

1. ""These warnings are not an effort to undermine the fostering of innovation through our capital markets –**America was built on the ingenuity, vision and spirit of entrepreneurs who tackled old and new problems in new, innovative ways**. Rather, they are meant to educate Main Street investors that many promoters of ICOs and cryptocurrencies are not complying with our
securities laws and, as a result, the risks are significant.""

2. ""Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market participants. **Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry**. Businesses, especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel concepts and ideas.""

3. ""Said simply,**we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising**, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and
markets.""

==================================================================================
Highlights from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman

1. ""Traditionally, there has been a need for a trusted intermediary – for example a bank or other financial institution – to serve as a gatekeeper for transactions and many economic activities. **Virtual currencies seek to replace the need for a central authority or intermediary with a decentralized, rules-based and open consensus mechanism.  An array of thoughtful business, technology, academic, and policy leaders have extrapolated some of the possible impacts that derive from such an innovation, including how market participants conduct transactions, transfer ownership, and power peer-to-peer applications and economic systems.**""

2. ""...In fact, virtual currencies may be all things to all people: **for some, potential riches, the next big thing, a technological revolution, and an exorable value proposition; for others, a fraud, a new form of temptation and allure, and a way to separate the unsuspecting from their money.**""

3. ""The CFTC and SEC, along with other federal and state regulators and criminal authorities, will continue to work together to bring transparency and integrity to these markets and, importantly, **to deter and prosecute fraud and abuse**. These markets are new, evolving and international. As such **they require us to be nimble and forward-looking**; coordinated with our state, federal and
international colleagues; and engaged with important stakeholders, including Congress.""

4. ""**We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination.**""

5. ""**With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity. This hearing is an important part of finding that balance.**""

"A Warning to All: Coinbase is holding $16,000 USD Hostage with no ability to buy, sell, withdraw, or close account and has provided Zero customer support or solution.",2239,7xfic6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7xfic6/a_warning_to_all_coinbase_is_holding_16000_usd/,557,1518611355.0,"**TL:DR Had perfectly functioning 100% verified Coinbase account with thousands of dollars transferred and spent on coins. Transferred 16,000USD. Went to buy Coin during a dip and Verification was mysteriously revoked with no notification or warning. SSN verification will not accept any form of my information after 100+ attempts. Account completely gridlocked - cannot buy/sell crypto or withdraw funds back into origin bank account in any dollar amount. Called customer service several times and they offer no phone support and no solution other than emails saying they cannot help me but a ""specialist"" is on the case and it is a ""priority 10"". After 1 month I requested to close my Coinbase account only to be told that my account cannot be closed until all money is Withdrawn. WTF Coinbase**

**Updates:**

**+I have seen a lot of suggestions that I am attempting to withdraw too much money. The dollar value is completely irrelevant. I have tried anywhere from $1 to $16,000 and it's the same result.**

**+Other people are calling me stupid for Wiring money. The $16,000 was not one giant wire transfer. It was a combination of ACH transfers and one wire. This happened over a two week time period where I was not buying any coin. My verification just as easily could have been mysteriously revoked before any of the money was even sent to my Coinbase account. They still knowingly took the money and are now too incompetent to remedy the verification issue. I fail to see how people can tell me I did something wrong in this scenario. Should no new money come into Cyrpto?**

**+Many people are also speculating I did something illegal. I don't have to justify myself to interwebz people but there has been nothing but long term hold and investments. if I was stupid enough to perform illicit activity with my coinbase account or other wallets... Would I really be posting about it here?**


Original Post:

I would like to start out by saying I really wish I did not have to do this, however given the circumstances I am exhausting all my options.  I apologize for the length but I need to get this out there as it maybe will help others make informed decisions about which exchanges to use. 

 I setup and fully verified a Coinbase account towards the later half of 2017. I was able to make successful ACH transfers into my USD Wallet and subsequently purchase thousands of dollars of crypto. I also had zero issues with credit card purchases. Other than not being able to get verified on GDAX so far so good. 
Fast forward to early January 2018. I decided to convert more Fiat into Crypto so I did a combination of wire and ACH transfer to what amounted to $16,000 USD. I waited for my respective coin to hit my re-buy point and went to make a large purchase only to be greeted by an error telling me that I needed to verify my SSN. This is very strange considering I had been fully verified with no issues purchasing before. Okay no problem - I enter my information which includes basics such as full name, address, SSN, occupation, etc. For whatever reason this fails along with several other attempts with varying aspects of information. After several failed attempts it locks me out for 24 hours. Over the next few days I rinse and repeat the process of varying my information and getting locked out for 24 hours. 

After around 100 failed attempts it was evident to me that no combination of my information would work. On Jan. 17 I decided to call the 800 number and speak directly to customer service. The lady I spoke with was friendly and seemed to understand as I walked her through the issue. After I had convinced her I had exhausted every possible combination of my information she recommended that I get referred to a ""specialist"" who would be able to immediately correct this issue. She said that in order to escalate the case number she would need to send me an email explaining common solutions for failed ID quiz (we already covered on the phone) as a formality and I would only need to reply back saying that I have already attempted the common solutions. Once I replied back she would be able to forward to a ""specialist"" and escalate to a ""priority 10"". Naturally I replied to the email immediately asking for this to be addressed. Here is the response I received: 

*""Hi there,
I’m sorry to hear that you are still having difficulty verifying your ID through the quiz. As I mentioned we use a third party to facilitate the quiz, and sometimes they just don’t have enough or up-to-date information.
If you’ve tried several times and still can’t successfully complete the quiz, unfortunately there may just not be enough information to verify you at this time.
You are welcome to continue trying to take the quiz as often as you’d like (there is a limit to the number of times you can try per day), as it is possible that the information may update and you could pass. You may also want to try entering different variations of your address, as that is one of the most common causes of not passing the quiz.
In some cases, this verification may be required to continue purchasing through Coinbase. However, in many cases it is not required, and you should still be able to purchase digital currency up to your daily limit with an unverified account as well as use many of Coinbase’s features for buying, selling and transferring digital currency.
In the future we may be able to implement a different method for verifying identity, but at this time we cannot manually verify your ID.
Again I’m sorry for the difficulty with the quiz. Thank you for using Coinbase.""*


WTF??? This is completely opposite of what the lady on the phone told me. Did she just tell me this to get me off the phone and now they send me an email saying ""we can't help you""? What do you mean you can't help me... you have $16,000 of my money. I immediately call back and speak to another operator asking what the deal was. She reassured me that the case was going to a ""specialist"" and would be a ""priority 10"" and sends me an email saying she is working with a specialist to address it properly. Obviously I am very perturbed at this point, however I let cooler heads prevail and try a few more days of entering my information. Of course this lead to zero success. 

I wait until Jan 24th and call back into the the 800 number to speak with an agent. After I politely explained the situation to the phone agent lo and behold they refer me to a ""specialist"" as the phone agent is unable to do anything other than verify I have a case open and it's a ""priority 10"". Before I let them hang up the phone on me and send me another email saying it's being looked at I ask if there is a way for the agent to look at the que and give me an estimate of when this will be resolved. Naturally there is no que or case# tracking system according to the agent. I also ask if I can have a number to speak with a specialist direct -- ""No you cannot speak with them"". What about email directly to a specialist? - ""No you cannot do that either"".  Can you call the specialist and speak with them? ""No we cannot do that"".  Can you call the specialist and conference me in with them? ""No we cannot do that either"". Okay so we are back to the wait for a specialist routine. The agent doubly reassures me that it will be resolved as fast as it possibly can because it is a ""priority 10"" so I reluctantly hang up the phone as it appears there is no other option. 

My mentality at this point was to call back in every day so I call back in on the 25th and essentially have a mirror image of the conversation from the 24th. At this point I realize this is going nowhere so I decide I will transfer my money back into my bank account and move to another exchange. I log into coinbase to make the transfer and WTF?!?! I can't transfer my money back into my account it came from without verifying my SSN and other information. Surely this is a joke that I have to have my SSN verified to move my own money back into the exact account it came from. At this point my mentality has moved beyond FOMO coin mania and into territory of - they have a decent amount of my money and I don't know if I will be able to get it back. 

It took every ounce of strength but I decided to take a zen-like approach and give it some more time. Absolutely zero correspondence or change in status on my Coinbase account over the next 2 weeks. On Feb 9 I made the decision to call in and make one last attempt and if the results are the same I would close my account live over the phone. The agent I spoke with gave me the same pitch of already being escalated to a ""specialist"" and there was nothing he could do further.  I really went to town and explored all options so fun facts I learned from that conversation: 1) The agent and specialist do not communicate directly 2) Apparently there is no governing authority over either of these entity's that bridges to two 3) you cannot speak with anyone above the agent, not even a supervisor? 4) You can't communicate with a specialist - but we already knew that one. 5) Specialists ""DO EXIST"" 6) the phone agent cannot view if your case has been looked at or give you an estimate of when it will be completed.  7) A phone agent will ""put you on hold"" to pretend like they are speaking with someone (not a specialist) in order to appease you into believing they are doing something constructive towards a resolution. 

 Clearly this is not getting resolved and the whole phone agent schtick is a lost cause. I immedately requested that my account be terminated and my money returned to me. I was greeted with the following ""Sir, you cannot close your account until you transfer all of your money out of your coinbase account"" Let that sink in for a moment. I cannot buy crypto, sell crypto, or transfer any USD until my SSN is verified. My SSN and information cannot be verified through the normal Coinbase verification and there is no manual way to do it nor will they provide any live customer support to work towards a resolution. I cannot close my account until all my money is transferred and there are no alternative ways to transfer money out of a Coinbase account. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F!@#$. 

Coinbase literally has my $16,000 USD held hostage as there is no solution other than ""wait for a specialist who may or may not be a real thing other than what we tell you to get you off the phone"".  I had a fully verified and functioning account - this is not an error on my end or me being pissy because I couldn't buy coin at the right time. They knowingly took $16,000 USD and then removed my verification status, have provided zero evidence of a solution, and then deny me when I make a move to close my account. I would have to believe that there are legal boundaries being crossed by denying me to close my account. I can look past the FOMO and the untold loss potential on having this amount of capital gridlocked but I cannot forgive them not even allowing me to close my account. I could even possibly make amends with this entire situation if I felt that I was receiving customer support that built trust they were actually looking for a resolution and not just telling me whatever to get me off the phone. Who knows what's really going on behind the scenes. 

My biggest problem with all of this - Coinbase certainly had ZERO issue taking the USD incoming but when it comes to the reverse its a big FU. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Recommendations? I have thought about contacting a lawyer and seeing what my options are. I also contemplated going to appropriate US authoritative bodies but I really would prefer to not bring negative attention to crypto.

I remember when you can grab them at $4k last year, but I had never seen this bull run coming before. Whatever, the last best time to buy was yesterday, the next best time is today.

But ETH just has so much room to grow. It runs most of the DeFi ecosystem and NFTs, getting network upgrades like EIP 1559 making it less inflationary, ETH 2.0 making the blockchain green and drastically reduce fees, and tons of institutional adoptions alongside bitcoin. There's just so many bullish things in store for ETH long term.

ETH would have a mcap of $6T if $51.9k. But watch; [the global stock market has total value $95T](https://spendmenot.com/blog/stock-market-statistics/). So it's realistic. Consider that fiat is heavily depreciating too.

Also mention BTC would only have to 6x to get to $6T.

Will it take over BTC as market cap? Very unlikely. Will it decrown BTC as king of crypto? Hell no.

But ETH will probably be just as sought after and extremely high valued just like BTC is today. I'm very bullish on it.",2021-04-28 03:54:32

But everything you know right now, you will know when you magically become your 2010 self. (I.e. you will be aware of the fact that you just traveled back in time.)

If there are things you have today that are irreplaceable (kids, family, whatever you love) is it worth this risk of those things maybe not happening due to some fluke or twist of fate that changes those things forever, even if you carefully relive your life to try and make them happen again (you know, other than becoming rich as fuck slowly over a decade)? Or was the past 11 years unavoidably painful in a way that not even any amount of money could make reliving it worth it? Or are you ready to go and wondering how anyone could possibly have any problem whatsoever with jumping on this opportunity, what a stupid question? Somewhere in between?

# Brave Introduces Beta of Private Tabs with Tor for Enhanced Privacy while Browsing

Today we’re releasing our latest desktop browser [Brave 0.23](https://brave.com/download/) which features Private Tabs with [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), a technology for defending against network surveillance. This new functionality, currently in beta, integrates Tor into the browser and gives users a new browsing mode that helps protect their privacy not only on device but over the network. Private Tabs with Tor help protect Brave users from ISPs (Internet Service Providers), guest Wi-Fi providers, and visited sites that may be watching their Internet connection or even tracking and collecting IP addresses, a device’s Internet identifier.

Private Tabs with Tor are easily accessible from the File menu by clicking New Private Tab with Tor. The integration of Tor into the Brave browser makes enhanced privacy protection conveniently accessible to any Brave user directly within the browser. At any point in time, a user can have one or more regular tabs, session tabs, private tabs, and Private Tabs with Tor open.

The Brave browser already automatically blocks ads, trackers, cryptocurrency mining scripts, and other threats in order to protect users’ privacy and security, and Brave’s regular private tabs do not save a user’s browsing history or cookies. Private Tabs with Tor improve user privacy in several ways. It makes it more difficult for anyone in the path of the user’s Internet connection (ISPs, employers, or guest Wi-Fi providers such as coffee shops or hotels) to track which websites a user visits. Also, web destinations can no longer easily identify or track a user arriving via Brave’s Private Tabs with Tor by means of their IP address. Users can learn more about how the Tor network works by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/JWII85UlzKw).

Private Tabs with Tor default to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as the search engine, but users have the option to switch to one of Brave’s other nineteen search providers. DuckDuckGo does not ever collect or share users’ personal information, and welcomes anonymous users without impacting their search experience — unlike Google which challenges anonymous users to prove they are human and makes their search less seamless.

In addition, Brave is contributing back to the Tor network by running Tor [relays](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html). We are proud to be adding bandwidth to the Tor network, and intend to add more bandwidth in the coming months. Our relays can be viewed at: [https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:FBC2856A48705F3ED17E504F8FC89EC6433ED25D](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:FBC2856A48705F3ED17E504F8FC89EC6433ED25D)

Since Brave’s implementation of Private Tabs with Tor is currently in beta, there are still some known issues and [leaks](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Abrave+label%3Ator%2Fleakproofing&type=Issues)which we intend to fix in future versions. We welcome developer contributions to our Private Tabs with Tor feature via [GitHub](https://github.com/brave), and look forward to releasing updated versions in the coming weeks. We also plan to include support to choose exit node geolocation in the future. For users who currently require leakproof privacy, we recommend using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en), which provides much stronger and well-tested protection against websites or eavesdroppers using advanced techniques to uncover a true IP address.

We’re excited about providing our users with a new way to protect the privacy of their browsing habits, especially as more sites and advertisers are using tracking techniques and abusing user trust. Our user-first approach aims to standardize a privacy-by-default model that gives users ownership of their data and online experience, and Tor integration via Private Tabs vastly contributes to our platform.

Note: In addition to Private Tabs with Tor, Brave 0.23 features an updated icon set, refinements to the primary toolbar styling and dimensions, adjustments for tab previews, and usability improvements in the title-mode feature of the URL bar. Brave 0.23 also includes improved compatibility with Google’s suite of productivity tools, which now work better with Brave’s default Shield settings.",2018-06-28 19:54:35

"Rohan Grey, advisor to the Democrat Congress Reps who put forth a new bill to ban stablecoins, is advocating to ban running blockchain nodes. We should demand that Stanford and the UN ICT agency sever all connections to him. What he is advocating is absolutely totalitarian and monstrously evil",2167,k5tzs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k5tzs0/rohan_grey_advisor_to_the_democrat_congress_reps/,419,1607015825.0,"He is currently Vice-Chair (Privacy) of the [Digital Currency Global Initiative](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/extcoop/dcgi/Pages/default.aspx), which is a joint project by the International Telecommunication Union, which is the UN ICT agency, and Stanford.

To advocate such a totaliarian position - where running a software node that operates according to an autonomous algorithm becomes illegal in the United States - means he is profoundly authoritarian in his mindset and agenda.

Ultimately his goal must be to either keep all cryptocurrency networks out of the US through extreme control over the internet within the US, or to eliminate all autonomous cryptocurrency networks from the world.

This would disenfranchise millions of people, and prevent the emergence of decentralized financial networks that have already shown they have the ability to dramatically improve the living conditions of people facing some of the most challenging socioeconomic conditions in the world.

To advocate for such a heavy-handed and illiberal respose to a voluntarily formed decentralized software network makes it completely inappropriate for an international organization like the UN, or a world renowned university like Stanford, to have any affiliation with him.

He's advocating nothing less than the total suppression of non-official human activity, and total bureaucratic supremacy, of the kind characteristic of the worst totalitarian societies.

We should contact the UN ICT Agency and Stanford and demand they distance themselves from someone advocating government measures that pose such a grave threat to human rights in the US and to financial empowerment worldwide.",2020-12-03 11:17:05

My post was removed in a couple of minutes. I asked the mods for a reason and got no response. 

So naturally, I thought I might have broken a rule. I checked the rules and saw that there was [one rule in particular](https://i.imgur.com/sGQF5nU.png) which stood out. Which loosely translated, IMO, means ""only say good stuff about this coin here"". Red flag.

That made sense as to why the subreddit is always getting posts from a lot of people glorifying it. 

Or were they actually people? *(cue Vsauce theme)*

I checked the newest posts for a while. I noticed a pattern in the usernames of the posts being made. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to direct your attention to these users:

u/Evening-Bluebird9402

u/Accurate_Repair1199

u/Prestigious_Mix_1876

u/Ok-Flight-2556

u/Acrobatic_Trouble220

u/fab2606

u/micsel_0991

u/trading___123

And many more. These are all accounts that have nothing but posts in the safemoon subreddit. The posts are either glorifying it or asking ""How to buy more"" questions. And here's the real kicker: All the accounts have been made on or around the 2 month mark. Right when Safemoon became a thing.

Am I wrong about this? Possibly. But I urge you to check the new posts yourself. Every 3-4 posts or so, there is one post that meets the pattern. What does it all mean? Idk. Do I have money stored in this? Yes. Am I going to bail? No. Why the fuck not? Cause I willing to lose what I've put in and I like hoping I'm wrong.

**Edit:** [One of the moderators of r/safemoon commented below](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv5nl9/i_did_some_digging_on_the_safemoon_subreddit/gvc9imb/). He makes a few points.

We got a new P.O.S since then and haven't set up any way to receive bitcoin. Last night however, someone came in who remembered all the hype and asked me if he could pay with Bitcoin. Said it was on ""his bucket list"". I told him he was in luck. I had him send it to me and I just paid cash into the register.

After the transaction, which we were both pretty amped about as I've never received crypto in the wild and he had never sent it, I told my boss what happened and he immediately told me I was in charge of making sure we can accept Bitcoin going forward.

I would like to share some of my tips and knowledge here, hope you like them! 

Guides:

Stick to your personal trading rules and ignore noise/hype. 

Don't FOMO into a coin. Price always pulls back so never chase the pump and never buy at the top. If there's nothing to buy. Wait for a good entry. Let the pump come back to you. 

Expectation: you won't get rich overnight. After buying a coin, don't expect it to double overnight. Just be very patient with a coin before considering selling it. Just remind yourself why you bought the coin in the first place! 

The crypto market is unpredictable, anything could happen. 

I wouldn't recommend leverage trade/ shorting now - We're in a bull market now so it's not wise to take extra risk to leverage trade or short the market. 

Remember: most traders lose money, and the richest people in the world you know are long term investors, not traders. 

I have made much more money by investing mid-long term than going 20x on trades thinking I'll get rich overnight. 

We're in the middle of a bull market now and I don't think we're at the top yet. There's still money to be made but don't expect you can 100x your money, though I believe 10x is still quite possible. 

On that note, just focus on finding your 10x coins rather than aiming for a 100x moon coin, it's just unrealistic now. The time to make 100x is gone. Prepare to buy in the next bear market to prepare for the next bull cycle, that's how people make 100x.

Exit strategy:

While it's fun and exciting when we're in the middle of a bull run. But remember, this bull market won't last forever. While it's good to take advantage of this opportunity to make life changing money, don't forget to plan your exit strategy. Always remember to take profits. 

For example: if you're lucky enough to make 10x. Take some out and put it in Btc/ Eth for long term investments. Take some out to a stable coin so you can rotate the profits into another 10x coin. Take some out to fiat so you can enjoy your money. Leave 5-10% in the original coin in case it will still moon. Have a plan! 

Know when to sell:

Write down your price target when you buy a coin so you can ignore noise, FOMO and emotions down the track. When the coin is approaching your price target then start shaving off the profits. Remember: you don't have to sell the whole thing, you can always sell 10%—20% to take some profit out. 

You can dollar cost average in, and you can always dollar cost average out.

Above is not financial advice.

Thanks guys for reading. Hope the above helps and hope we all get rich.

The creator of website **“freebitcoins.appspot.com”** where user could collect free Bitcoins is Gavin Andresen. The website is not working anymore.

[This is how the default page of the faucet looked like.](https://imgur.com/gallery/HvnAZ2k)

To fuel the first faucet, Andresen loaded it with 1,100 BTC of his own. After these were given away, the faucet was reloaded, with early bitcoin miners and whales also donating coins.

Andresen said that: “Bitcoins are a new kind of money, and that they aren’t created or controlled by a government like USD or EUR, they’re created and controlled by anybody who wants to be part of the Bitcoin payment network.”

This faucet managed to give away to people 19,700 Bitcoins which is now worth $1,171,852,530.

[Here is the Andresens original post about the faucet that he posted in June 11, 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=183.0). I highly recommend you to read it. To imagine that someone gave him back 50 BTCs just because he felt bad for getting 5 for free is ridiculous now.

I thought it would be great idea to share this nice piece of history.

Have a nice day !",2021-04-11 18:16:49

Every five days since then ADA has seen an increase of 2% (additively) in community block production.

ADA is currently 98% decentralized and is on course to reach 100% decentralization on March 31st. This means that the 1800 already existing community pools will be responsible for creating **all** new blocks. Congrats to ADA and the holders for trying to keep crypto true to its purpose.

Letter to my younger self,2073,mgpt9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mgpt9l/letter_to_my_younger_self/,549,1617166587.0,"I've been in crypto since 2017... and over the years I've made every single wrong. If I could build a time machine and tell my younger self a few things, these would be it:

&#x200B;

1. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME
   1. While money comes quickly in crypto, as compared to traditional markets, it goes away even faster. Your profit, and return on investment, is directly corelated to the amount of work, effort, research, and attention, you put into your investments. If you do it right, you will have a ton of success... if you don't, your failure will be epic in so many ways.
   2. Things might sound outlandish in crypto, but if you follow rule #1, you'll be able to figure out which have potential, and which ones are never going to reach the daylight. If someone is trying to make you ""Get in right now or you'll never be rich"" that's ok... let them have the glory of monster gains, there are plenty to be had that will fit your needs. I'll tell you below how to figure out which projects are good and which ones are not.
2. PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT BEING THE BEST IN CRYPTO ARE NOT
   1. If you run across someone that constantly says that they are the best (paid group leaders come to mind), they are far from it. The one's that are the best let their work talk for them, and they are more than happy to help others be successful for free.
   2. The biggest names in crypto are the ones that show you their work... If you have doubts about someone being who they are, just ask them to show you their P&L. If they are genuine, they will do so without hesitation, if they are not... they will give you an excuse of why they will not. ""I only talk to real Alphas"" is not the right response to this.
3. YOUR NET WORTH IS NOT THE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE
   1. It is easy to look at some people turning $5,000 into $500,000 in 6 months and thinking that you should do the same... you won't. Some of these people are incredibly talented, gifted, and dedicated traders who spend 8-12 hours every day working on their portfolio. They have years of experience that makes them good at what they do... or they are just really lucky. Either way, you're not going to beat them until you become the same.
   2. Being successful in crypto means different things to different people. Set your goals early and gauge your success based on your goals. ""I want to be rich"" is not a goal, it's a dream. ""I want to make $100K this year using crypto"" is a goal... ""I want to be a millionaire in 2 years with crypto"" is a goal. Once you make it, figure out what you need to achieve it. You might have to educate yourself, you might have to practice trading on paper before doing it for real, you might have to lose some money before you make some. Just make sure you know what you're trying to do and what you need to do to get there.
   3. The biggest thing that will stop you from succeeding is your ego. Be humble, be smart, be the one that people want to be around. You'll get much further in life if you swallow your pride and admit your mistakes.
4. DO YOUR RESEARCH NO MATTER WHAT
   1. Whitepaper
      1. Does it make sense?
      2. Does it solve a problem that needs solving?
      3. Does it solve it better than anyone else out there?
      4. Is there direct competition, if so research them
   2. Management team
      1. Are they experienced in the field they are trying to enter?
      2. Do they have someone external helping them enter the field?
      3. Do they have experience leading startups or history of long term business development?
   3. Adoption
      1. Are people talking about it or is it so far off the beaten path that a handful of fanboys know about it... if it is latter, it's probably not a good projects
      2. Market cap and volume... a great sign of adoption is high volume as relative to the market cap... you want to see volume in the 10% of the market cap at least... So if you have a $10M market cap coin, at least $1m should be traded on a daily basis... $50M cap coin means $5M trading volume... etc. and majority of that trading needs to come from a large variety of wallets. You want big holding wallets, and small wallets to be moving the coin around... it shows a healthy ecosystem. To that note, small transactions on regular intervals are bots keeping the network alive... if that is most of the volume... MOVE ON.
   4. Execution
      1. Once you get into the coin, it is important to track the progress of execution. Everything might look good on paper but if they are not able to make their idea into a reality you will see a bunch of fluff news around but no actual implementation
      2. Crypto companies move at the speed of light. They knock out projects in weeks and months, not years. If you run across a team and project that has very few executed projects across a long time span, there is something wrong. Especially if they keep saying  ""Great things are coming"" ""Amazing stuff is about to happen"" What a traditional company does on 5 years, a crypto company can do in 1... so if they have been around for 4-5 years and they don't have much to their name, it's a shitcoin... you should move on
      3. Is there transparency with the investors? If the team is not willing to share their roadmap with the investors (YOU) and is reluctant to keep up with regular updates, then something is not right. Right teams will not only update people on the things that are going on but they will also engage the base on a daily basis to keep the interest alive. They need to be as excited about the project as you are.
      4. Check their GitHub. A good project will have some data on there and you will be able to parse through it to find out if it is legit or not. If it doesn't look right, you might want to move on (Credit u/klock23s)
5. RISK MANAGEMENT MATTERS
   1. Catching falling knives is dangerous. Don't try to be perfect on your entry and exit. No one can predict that. If you have done your homework, you'll know the entry range, the exit range and the right time to act. When you do, act with intent, not doubt.
   2. Diversification is going to be a key to your success. Invest in a wide variety of projects, different industries, different fields. No one industry or project will reign supreme so make sure that you cast a wide net.
   3. Don't put in more than 3-5% of your net holdings into any single project. That doesn't mean that you should ONLY invest 3-5%, no... it just means that any single project should have no more than 3-5% of your overall holdings.
   4. Use stop loss if you are swing trading, if you're not then have a number in mind where you're going to cut your losses. 98% of traders lose money, it's a simple fact... most of them lose money because they have crappy risk management. Even if you're in love with a project, you should know when to get out. Things change so re-evaluate often. More importantly, if you risked only 3-5% of your portfolio, even without stop loss, you're going to do OK.
   5. No one is perfect, if you are a trader that has a 70% strike rate (meaning that 70% of your trades are profitable) you will come across a losing streak where 5-6 of trades you have will be bad. Without risk management, those trades could wipe you clean and leave you broke. to recover a 50% loss, you have to make it up with 100% gain to break even... doubling your portfolio is not that easy. Most successful traders have a strike rate of 40%, so using proper risk management is key to their success.
   6. Keep a journal of all the trades, entries, reasonings, rationale. Part of risk management is knowing when you F-ed up... you won't know that until later and you need to know why. Learning from your mistakes is hard when you don't know what you did that was so wrong. (Credit: u/LittleAce7)

Remember, these are rules and not law. There are exceptions to every rule, but if you have too many exceptions, then you don't have any rules in place. So use caution if you decide to not follow one or more of these.

Most importantly though, remember that crypto and trading is not life. You only live once, and while you will fail often, make sure that you take the time and dedicate it to the things that are more important in your life. Spend time with your family, spend time with your loved ones and share with them the precious little that you have.

No mater what, even if you lose it all, don't give up. Lessons can be costly, but you will be stronger in the end. If you learn from your mistakes, I can guarantee you that you will come out OK in the end. Trust me, I've done it... and I'm doing just fine!

See you in the future.

P.S. Surround yourself with people that are willing to help you succeed. People that will cheer you on with every step forward you make. People that will be happy if you're doing better than them, but if you're not they will give you advice on what you can do better/different. There are many people out there like that, find one first... then find more. Once you do, your success will be almost guaranteed.",2021-03-30 23:56:27

Bitcoin maximalists are toxic as hell and seriously ruin the vibe for newcomers.,2052,mi9796,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mi9796/bitcoin_maximalists_are_toxic_as_hell_and/,878,1617353054.0,"Bitcoin maximalists are people who believe Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that will succeed and call all other coins “shitcoins”. They degrade and insult any newcomer that shows even a little bit of interest in any other altcoin. They call people holding anything other than Bitcoin “shitcoiners”.

Really? Absolutely no other technology will have any utility other than Bitcoin? Nothing? Smart contracts have absolutely no value? The fact that you can have programmable money has no value? DeFi and providing liquidity to millions of unbanked people has no value? NFTs have no value? Come on. 

I think this is a very closed-minded and insecure mentality. It really feels like a cult. If the slightest mention of any coin other than BTC triggers you so much that you have to resort to name calling, it’s really telling of your intellect and position. I think it’s hilarious that you can’t even admit some of the obvious shortcomings in Bitcoin and some of the innovations of other coins. “Peer to peer electronic cash”. Lol. There is such a vast ecosystem out there and this cultish behavior just stifles adoption and scares away a lot of newcomers.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying Bitcoin is bad or will fail- I love BTC and want it to succeed. I’m just annoyed at the closed mindedness and cultish behavior. This is not a zero-sum winner takes all game. Multiple coins can exist and serve multiple use cases. 

These people are mainly notoriously active on Twitter and a new social media app called Clubhouse. The recent drama with [Lex Fridman](https://youtu.be/yB5WGV4zlgw) really opened my eyes to how toxic this community is. I think Lex is a great guy who often spreads love and positivity and they even managed to vilify him lol. I would love for the cryptocurrency community to be much more accepting and put forward thoughtful arguments instead of resorting to insults. 

tl;dr - Bitcoin maximalism is a toxic insecure cult that can’t handle any other coin seeing success and they spread unnecessary negativity in the crypto community.

Edit: lol some butthurt people are downvoting this thread and all the comments under it hard.

Edit 2 : here are some links of some of the assholery on Twitter since some were asking [link](https://twitter.com/apompliano/status/1376300966396452872?s=21), [link](https://twitter.com/excellion/status/1377889241200353282?s=21), [link](https://twitter.com/btcklausschwab/status/1377060728201482240?s=21), [link](https://twitter.com/bitcointina/status/1373601736670261251?s=21), [link ](https://twitter.com/chrisknight407/status/1378008661616902155?s=21), [link ](https://twitter.com/chrisknight407/status/1376246533436366854?s=21), [link](https://twitter.com/americanhodl3/status/1377022078960889858?s=21). 

Edit 3: A lot of salty maxis in the comments are equating this post to a “I hate Bitcoin” rant. Please read it again. I love Bitcoin. I love the philosophy and revolution. I want it to succeed. I want us to be on the Bitcoin standard. I’m just calling out the unnecessary negativity and elitism of a few people that seem to represent the crypto community on other platforms like Clubhouse and Twitter. All I’m saying is that it’s not a zero sum game. There are many other use-cases in the financial world that other projects can satisfy that Bitcoin couldn’t. And that’s okay.

[Full blog post with all the tables](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-two-years-2018-2-xxromn)

tl;dr - Thanks to some good news out of China, October produced gains which snapped a three month losing streak. $1000 investment in Top Ten cryptos on January 1st, 2018 is now worth about $192. **Bitcoin** maintains overall leader position followed by **Litecoin** then **Ethereum.**  Take the two Top Ten experiments together, I'm down -21%.

\*\*NOTE\*\* - I usually like to release the two posts a day apart, but I'll be spacing out the Top Ten 2018 and the Top Ten 2019 reports a bit more as readers have mentioned they've been removed by the mods (no offence taken, mods - the content is quite similar, I assume the posts are being removed because they're seen as  identical. \*\*END NOTE\*\*

# The Experiment:

Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2018/2019 crypto space. I’m trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet.

I have also started a [parallel project:](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe) on January 1st, 2019, I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) into the new Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st *2019*. Spoiler alert: the 2019 Experiment makes for much happier reading.

# The Rules:

Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2018. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe).

# Month Twenty-Two - Down 81%

Thanks to some positive news out of China, October decisively broke a three month losing streak for the 2018 Top Ten portfolio. All cryptos in the experiment were either up or flat this month, a welcome change from summer's downward trend.

# Ranking and October Winners and Losers

Although the market as a whole gained, a few of our 2018 Top Ten coins had trouble keeping up. **IOTA** and **NEM** each dropped two places to #18 and #27, respectively. **Dash** slid three slots, and now teeters on the edge of the Top Twenty. On the positive side **Bitcoin Cash** gained one position in the rankings, climbing to the four spot.

*October Winners* \- **Bitcoin Cash** rebounded nicely after a dismal September finishing +29% up on the month. **Ripple** and **Stellar** had solid months as well, ending October at +16% and +14% respectively.

*October Losers* \- Only **IOTA** lost value this month, down -1%. Along with **NEM** and **Dash**, the three were basically flat in October.

For those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first 22 months of this experiment. Most monthly wins (5): **Bitcoin**. Most monthly loses (5): **Stellar**. All cryptos have at least one monthly win. The only two coins never to lose a month? **Bitcoin** and **Dash**.

# Overall update – Bitcoin far ahead of peers. Four worst performers down over -90% each, NEM still in basement.

**Bitcoin** is still miles ahead of the pack maintaining a *40+ percentage point lead* over second place **Litecoin** and third place **Ethereum**. This isn't even the widest lead **Bitcoin** has held since I started the experiment nearly two years ago: August 2019's +50% lead is still the record.

Looking through my past reports, poor **NEM** has been stuck in the basement all year. Since January 2019 is has been the experiment's worst overall performer. **NEM** is currently down -96% followed by **Cardano**, **Dash**, and **IOTA** all down over -90% since January 1st, 2018. My initial $100 investment in **NEM** is worth just $4.49.

40% of the cryptos that started 2018 in the Top Ten have dropped out, specifically **NEM, Dash, IOTA**, and **Cardano**. They have been replaced by **EOS, Binance Coin, Tether,** and **BTCSV**.

# Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector:

Breaking a three month losing streak, crypto ended October in positive territory, up about +$26B by month's end. The overall market cap is sitting around the $248B mark, rebounding to September 2019 levels. Since January 2018, the total market cap is down -57%.

If you're looking for a silver lining, followers of my [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://www.publish0x.com/top-ten-cryptocurrency-index-fund-experiments/experiment-tracking-top-10-cryptocurrencies-2019-month-nine-xyqkqe) will note that there has been an increase of +74% in total crypto market cap since the beginning 2019.

# Bitcoin dominance:

**Bitcoin** dominance ticked down slightly in October, but no major shift from last month. For context, the range since the beginning of the experiment in January 2018 has been quite wide: a high of 70% in September 2019 and a low of 33% in February 2018.

# Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2018:

After three straight months of loses, the portfolio gained a modest $17 in October. If I cashed out today, my $1000 initial investment would return $192, down nearly -81%.

The 2019 Top Ten Experiment is doing a bit better. If I cashed that experiment out today, that $1,000 initial investment would return $1,387, a +39% gain. Full October report to come.

Taken together, here's the bottom bottom line: **after a $2000 investment in both the 2018 and the 2019 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my portfolios would be worth $1,579.**

That's down about -21%.

# Implications/Observations:

As always, the experiment's focus of solely holding the Top Ten Cryptos continues to be a losing approach. While the overall market is down -%57 from January 2018, the cryptos that began 2018 in the Top Ten are down **-81%** over the same period.

At no point in this experiment has this investment strategy been successful: the initial 2018 Top Ten have under-performed each of the twenty-two months compared to the market overall.

I'm also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The S&P 500 is now up +15.2% since the beginning of 2018. My initial $1k investment into crypto would have yielded about +$152 had it been redirected to the S&P.

# Conclusion:

Thanks to the news out of China, October ended up breaking the streak of three consecutive months of downward movement for crypto. Again, this shows that unpredictability is the norm in crypto: we seemed on track to continue the downward trend until the end of the year. With two months left in the year, will the October gains hold?

How I turned $1k into 300k in 2017's bull market (very long).,2043,kwk2ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kwk2ot/how_i_turned_1k_into_300k_in_2017s_bull_market/,377,1610584498.0,"First, English is my second language so please forgive my poorly organized, horribly formatted and super long story. Also I never shared this story before and wasn't really planning to, but I told it to one of my now close friend who is a crypto nerd like me and he said it was inspiring and that I should share it so here goes.

It's 2014 I am working a minimum wage job at a labels factory, I boxed the finished labels. 6 months later, I am promoted and I am head of the quality assurance department (happened super fast and everyone was amazed that it happened including myself :P ). I got a raise and life was good.One day the owner decided to hire a ""team leader"" basically a tier 2 boss.  An authoritarian racist c\*nt that hates my guts. We get in an argument, I turn my back on him and walk away and he ends up physically assaulting me for it. I threaten to sue and they fire me because of it.

I complain to the EEOC, because I can't afford a lawsuit. We mediate and like an idiot I settled for 5k they offered me. I Payed my lawyer $400, Bought us a new furnace because ours was old and had broke down. I replace the kitchen sink, paint the house and did some other minor repairs.

All said and done, and after working for nearly 2 years at that company I am unemployed, depressed and have nothing to show for it, Well except for a $1000 I have left from the settlement that I wanted to preserve and invest in something instead of spending it.

&#x200B;

I spend a couple month of freelancing and hustling trying to find a new source of income. And one day I am on some random forum trying to find a solution to a problem I have with my code (I have 13+ years of programming experience C++, C#, Asm and reverse engineering) I read the word Bitcoin for the first time ever. And the person talking about it made it sound like it's the next big thing and that it's going to do wonders for apps and payment systems.

Other replies to that same post were talking about how it will make them all rich. I got curious, And on September, 2015, I google Bitcoin for the first time ever and I end up on Coinbase. I bought $5 worth of Bitcoin for shit's and giggles. Forgot about it for \~3 months. Then came back and sold it in October for $5.10. So I made 10 cents profit after coinbase's outrageous fees. And I thought to myself, This is great, I just made 2% with minimal effort. Greed kicked in and I started my quest to learn as much as I can about BTC.

For the skeptics:

Edit: More proof for those that think I am a lair, full of shit and made all this up:

Next thing I know I am on Coinbase Pro (Gdax at the time) and was instantly hypnotized by the insane volatility and price swings. I immediately start buying and selling, Without any knowledge about trading whatsoever. I made some money then then lost more than I made and now I have \~$820 left and I realized I am not going to beat the market like this. My orders were being front ran by bots (didn't know they were bots at the time) because they keep burying my limit orders whenever I post them and I don't get filled. Also fees for market orders were exceeding my profit so I end up losing instead of making money.

Thinking like a programmer (a problem solver really) I thought to myself there has to be a way for me to do the front running. I do some googling. Learn about the exchange API. I fired up Visual Studio, downloaded some files/libraries and spent a few weeks creating a prototype that would speed things up and give me an edge. At first I used C# and it looked like crap but it performed well, And with the ability to place orders as fast as possible (and free limit orders). My balance started growing.

Slowly but surely I kept improving the prototype over the years and it evolved into a fully functional trading platform. I eventually used Directx to recreate the order books locally (this part happened much later 2019-ish) because the exchange kept freezing and crashing when I needed it the most and low and behold, I had out done myself and created a fine trading platform [Here is the post were I first showed it to the world.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gqu05z/my_custom_made_desktop_crypto_trading_platform/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Here is a video of it in action too: [https://streamable.com/3jl30l](https://streamable.com/3jl30l)

&#x200B;

One click insta buy/sell and everything was pre-calculated for me. All I had to do was pre-set the # of lots I wish to flip in each trade and click either the buy or sell buttons.

&#x200B;

Within a few weeks of the first prototype I was up from $800 to 8k scalping BTC's volatile market and I was ecstatic, I was over the moon, pun intended. However, The market was slowing down and it is now boring and I am not making any $$ and I was never happy that I could only trade BTC and LTC on Coinbase and was scared to trade anywhere else for fear of losing my money with all the hacks and scams that were happening almost everyday. But then I learn about a coin called Lisk. And the Lisk zealots managed to convert me and I end up joining them and opened a Bittrex account lol.

&#x200B;

By now I had spent 3k in life expenses and I have 5k left so I move it to Bittrex, And add Bittrex to my trading platform and go all in on Lisk at $3. I was convinced it is going to the moon and will make me rich. I go to my wife and beg her to borrow some money from her dad for me or max out a credit card or whatever the fuck she can do to get me a few more thousand dollars so that I could add more to my LSK position because I have no credit score history and no one would lend me, She was terrified and refused to help me. I didn't get a single dime. (Hindsight, I am glad she didn't :P)

&#x200B;

So there I was, Angry at my wife (I was wrong I know) determined to prove her wrong and show her that this will work and that I am not going to lose so I am trading like a degenerate gambler with my entire stack. Looking like a zombi from malnutrition and lack of sleep, But I pull through and grow that 5k into \~24k within roughly 1.5 months. Phew, I DID IT, I shout. looking at my wife. I FUCKING DID IT. I TOLD I CAN DO IT but you never believed in me. And my head grew bigger and bigger to the point were it wouldn't fit through the door any more. Meanwhile LTC is pumping like a mother fucker but I had no idea because I am not paying attention to anything else but my cash cow LISK. Now that LISK is slowing down (Re-branding delayed) and hype was dead. I sell it all. Transfer the cash back to Gdax and join the LTC frenzy.

By now it's December 2017, And shit was Insane, It was lit, Everything was on steroids and $ signs everywhere. I was going all in on every trade (Spot trading) and with every trade and my account kept growing. First it was growing hundreds, Then LTC went parabolic and it was thousands of $$ with every click of the mouse. Every click of the buy/sell buttons I made or lost a few thousand $$. Never holding on to a position loser or winner. I catch the wicks (which were huge) and would flip it in seconds just to go back to fiat for fear of getting whipsawed and losing it all.

&#x200B;

By now I had grown my 24k into 100k within like 3 days at the markets peak (LTC at like $150+). The joy I felt, The happiness, The pride :) I was victorious and those 3 days were like a crazy epic dream.

So now I am gloating and teasing my wife telling her how I did it all by myself and shit and thanking her for all the help she didn't offer. meanwhile, LTC is still pumping like crazy. But I was content, I had just broken the 100k mark and was ready to celebrate. but of-course life is never sunshine and rainbows.

&#x200B;

To my dismay, My wife asks. What about TAXES?  I am like what taxes? I already payed the fees! (I am a foreigner so i knew nothing about taxes in the US of A) She said you have to pay capital gain taxes on this, It's like 30%. My face turned pale and my heart skipped a beat, I jump out of bed, go online and research capital gain taxes.

And I realized she was right, I am going to end up paying at least 25% to 32% of my money in taxes. I felt like I wanted to cry and all the joy and happiness I had felt was gone (Hindsight I should have been happy even after taxes :P). But I decided to push forward and make the 32% that I have to pay in taxes to get to the 100k mark after taxes while the market is hot.

so I cancelled the moon party and went back upstairs, Started the computer and started trading again.

&#x200B;

So now I am back at it, Still killing it making more and more money. This continues for a day or 2 more and by the time the crypto party was over and when LTC started the big crash from $400 to $150 I was all back in cash and I had made a grand total of 310k+ and 105k+ trades in about 6 months, Most trades were made in Dec 2017 and Jan 2018 on BTC, LTC and LSK combined.

&#x200B;

I at first protested paying taxes for weeks, No for months, because it seemed unfair to me. But the April 15th deadline drew ever closer. And our CPA scared me str8 telling me about all the fees and fines I would have to pay if I delay paying the IRS so I reluctantly agreed and paid all of my taxes to uncle Sam. It was a massive chunk of money to give away all at once and it made me sick to the stomach.

&#x200B;

And that my friends is the long-short version of the story of how I turned a $1000 into $300k. I hope to one day be able to tell a story of how I turned whatever I have left of the 300k now into a million $ or even better into a multi million dollar fortune :)

I know some people did like 1000x better than me, But for my story, I am proud of what I had achieved so far and I thought it would be cool to share the story and to hear other peoples success stories.

I still am still doing great in this bull market and trading crypto has been my full time job ever since I got fired from my job at the labels factory. I have grown a lot since. btw I thought about sending the owner of the factory that fired me a letter thanking him for firing me because it was the best thing that ever happened to me but I never did :P

&#x200B;

If you have made it this far. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, And wish you and everyone else the best of luck and riches beyond your wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I turned a $1000 I got from a EEOC settlement into $300k+ scalping LSK and LTC back in 2017 bull market.

Never forget that the Federal Reserve secretly gave $16 trillion dollars in bailouts to the big banks.,2041,mx1lkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mx1lkd/never_forget_that_the_federal_reserve_secretly/,318,1619230766.0,"*Sources:* [*Forbes*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2011/09/20/the-feds-16-trillion-bailouts-under-reported/)*,* [*CNBC*](https://www.cnbc.com/id/45674390)*,* [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/secrets-of-the-bailout-now-revealed.html)*,* [*Huffington Post*](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernankes-obfuscation-con_b_1147291)*,* [*Bernie Sanders press release*](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/the-fed-audit/)

**This is why we need cryptocurrency**. From December 2007 to November 10, 2011, the Federal Reserve, *secretly and without the awareness of Congress and the people*, funneled about $19.6 trillion to bail out the big banks on Wall Street and around the world. Just 14 global financial institutions received 83.9 percent or $16.41 trillion. These are the same institutions that were responsible for the financial crisis in the first place.

&#x200B;

[A list of the corrupt banks that received the secret bailouts and the amounts they received. \(source: http:\/\/www.levyinstitute.org\/pubs\/wp\_698.pdf\)](https://preview.redd.it/i1hurh03uwu61.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25abd8ee3fd35aaed81273344ee71cdb23d2780)

This was only found out because Bernie Sanders amended the Dodd-Frank Reform law to audit the Fed, pushing the GAO (Government Accountability Office) to step in and take a look around. Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and various other bankers vehemently opposed the audit and lied to Congress about the effects an audit would have on markets. This was the first audit of the Fed in the history of the United States since its beginnings in 1913. Unsurprisingly, this was scarcely reported by mainstream media – albeit the results are undoubtedly newsworthy. I find it funny that the American people were absolutely outraged that the federal government spent 700 billion dollars bailing out the “too big to fail” banks. Well, that bailout was pocket change compared to what the Federal Reserve did. Keep in mind that the GDP of the United States for the entire year of 2010 was only 14.58 trillion dollars. 19 trillion dollars is an almost inconceivable amount of money.

Take all of the outrage and debate over the $1.5 trillion deficit into consideration, and swallow this Red pill: There was **absolutely no debate** about whether $16,000,000,000,000 would be given to failing banks and failing corporations around the world. The Federal Reserve and the big banks fought for more than two years to keep details of the largest bailout in U.S. history a secret. I find it pretty evil that they had such incomprehensible amounts of money to throw around to corrupt financial institutions while regular people were suffering and struggling to find jobs. This kind of gross corruption is what led Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin.

tl;dr - Fuck the big banks. Fuck the Federal Reserve. Take back your financial power. Be your own bank.",2021-04-23 21:19:26

Makes sense.  He knew what he was doing, he knew the consequences, he knew how the corporate establishment worked.

He knew that the corporate establishment would do ANYTHING to smear him as a bad person. They would have looked into his life and found something wrong, and highlighted that Nationwide through corporate media, and all those non-coiners that you see today saying...

-  cryptocurrency is bad

-  cryptocurrency is used by criminals organizations to hide money

- crypto is a fad like tulips

- it has no value

- it's going to destroy the Earth as we know it.

**All of those people would buy into it like a $1,200 iPhone to use for selfies and Facebook only because it makes them feel smart**.

But Satoshi didn't only remain anonymous for this reason, he remained anonymous to protect you, he did it for you. He knew the corporate establishment had Mass control over the internet, and your privacy would be invaded like termites in a dead tree.

He knew your information being exposed can be used against you at any time if somebody powerful wanted to ruin your life for going against them. 

He knew that if he was smeared that way that there would have been Draconian laws well before 2017 preventing Bitcoin usage. 

###He knew the only way for it to be adopted before it can be taken down was for most people...

- not to hear about it before there were already enough adopters

- not to understand it so the establishment wouldn't understand enough to see it as a threat.

He knew it had to be a very slow adoption.

###Now you have countries nervous and trying to compete with it.

That's why China has the...

So hats off to Satoshi

Thanks for helping us establish decentralization against corporate nation.

"How I got into crypto, got free crypto, why I'm getting out and what I'll do with the money.",2016,n690d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n690d8/how_i_got_into_crypto_got_free_crypto_why_im/,293,1620341389.0,"I'm a website developer in my early 40's. To be honest, I should have gotten into crypto much sooner. I read about Bitcoin in the early 2012 or 2013 but I never really thought it would take off. To be honest, I thought it was one of those E-gold scams that used to exist back then. Every now and then I would read about it but I never had any interest in Bitcoin or any other crypto. In fact, I always thought Bitcoin was the only crypto that existed.

That changed in December 2017. I had a Shih Tzu named ""Gizmo"" who I had since he was only a few weeks old. Because I was always self employed and working from home, when he was little I would always keep him on my lap while I was working. And for the next more than 10 years, he would still sleep on my lap for hours, even though he got bigger and heavier. My legs often fell asleep but I didn't want to wake him up. Unfortunately, that day in 2017 Gizmo had a seizure. We raced to the vet in the middle of the night but it was too late. We never found out what really happened because I didn't want an autopsy. It was too painful. We opted to have him cremated and his ashes are still with me in my home office.

As I walked out of the vet office and I went to the counter to pay, the vet refused to take any payment. He did say however that he would accept a donation for an animal shelter if I insisted on paying. I gave him $100 and he asked me if I had a Doge wallet. That is the first time I had ever heard about it. Long story short, he introduced to me and as a ""thank you"" sent me back 4000 Doge, which I later found out was worth around $10. That was the first time I ever held any crypto.

I went home and forgot about it until a few months later when I found it had almost tripled to $30. I decided to buy another $200 worth of Doge and I now held a total of almost 30,000. Shortly after I bought more, it dumped hard and I thought I pretty much lost all of my money and therefor also lost interest in crypto.

Eventually, I changed mobile phones, too. For the next 3+ years, I didn't touch anything related to crypto even though I worked in web development every day. We got a new dog and although he has his own great personality, he can never replace Gizmo. And he doesn't need to. Anyways, this is not about my dog, I just wanted to mention that.

My non-interest in crypto came to an end in early 2021 however. Doge was suddenly all over the news and I searched all the boxes where we keep stuff we don't need anymore for that mobile phone. I found it after looking for almost an hour. I didn't have a cable to charge it anymore so I had to wait until next day to go buy one. I finally got home and it still worked. And I was still able to access my wallet.

Suddenly, my interest in crypto returned. I held my bag even though I everyone told me to sell in the past few months. I also bought some BTC, ADA, ETH, BTH and ATOM. I must admit, I didn't really do any research when I bought. I just bought the top ones and got lucky. I didn't lose any money and actually made some. But the best performed by far in my portfolio is obviously still Doge.

In the past 3 months, I've learned a lot about crypto and I'm ready to invest in it. But because of my newly acquired wealth of crypto knowledge, my run with Doge must also come to an end. I don't know if it will go on to $1 or even $10, but I've decided that it's now too risky to keep holding my $17,000+ worth. I predict that it will dump after this weekend but I could be wrong.

It's been a good run and I'm happy about it. I am going to symbolically keep 1 Doge in my wallet, forever. I will transfer it back to my original wallet and let the batteries run dry for one last time. And it will forever have a special place in my heart.

As for the money I will get, I will donate $5,000 to an animal shelter in my area that is in desperate need of funds. In the spirit of crypto, I will ask them about accepting the donation in crypto. If they do, I will make sure they understand the potential volatility. $17,000 is a lot of money for me because we live basically paycheck to paycheck depending on how much work I have so I can't afford to donate more. If I had more money, I would donate it all. And if I ever do make a lot of money with crypto, I will keep making donations. We also decided to get one more dog, a Shih Tzu once again. My girl joked about naming him/her Doge but no decisions have been made.

Anyways, that's it. Thank you for reading (if anyone even reads this) and for letting me share my story. I see a lot of negative opinions against certain coins around here and I just wanted to write something positive. We don't need to attack each other just because we hold different coins. Not everyone bought a specific coin because they saw it on TV and thought they could make a quick 1000x and not everyone who still holds a specific coin is delusional. We all have our opinions and reasons and we should all respect those of others who may be different than our own.",2021-05-06 17:49:49

The fact that US is printing alot of money is not solving the issue of common people. Those money going directly to rich people because 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for emergency expenses: Federal Reserve - [https://abcnews.go.com/US/10-americans-struggle-cover-400-emergency-expense-federal/story?id=63253846](https://abcnews.go.com/US/10-americans-struggle-cover-400-emergency-expense-federal/story?id=63253846) 

Those printing machines just keep printing money and keep creating wealth difference between rich and poor. They will make the rich richer and the poor poorer.

I strongly believe a great deal of these ""news"" articles have been brigaded or vote-manipulated.

""Russia investing in bitcoin = fake news."" Absolutely, I do not disagree with that. Taking a completely non-influential Russian's political beliefs on Twitter and spinning a news article on it - that's some bull shit. Conflicting articles on the legality of cryptocurrency in India, this is all dog shit.

If cryptocurrency is to be taken seriously, if it is to be the ""way of the future"", then its advent would only be accelerated by destroying websites that are profiting off of the fringes of the success of cryptocurrency. 

EDIT: If a political figure, political body, celebrity, or well-known entrepreneur / business owner (Elon Musk, Winklevoss Twins, a state senator, a massive city's mayor, a country's president, etc.) have something to say, usually they'll say it on Twitter and it's better for us to see what they say there than read some news source that's going to make 1000 words out of what these public figures can say in 280 characters on social media.

EDIT 2: While I won't list any specific articles, I suppose **some, purely 100% speculative** articles would be just fine. For example, if someone maintains a blog on Medium and investigates the topic of a particular bitcoin ETF, or if someone runs a wordpress blog and entertains the idea of banks offering cryptocurrency custody solutions, or if somebody cites real sources from real people without trying to jump to B.S. conclusions, I'm all for it!

These changes could severely stifle growth in the still-developing cryptomarket. With touchy topics like money laundering, darknet markets, and anonymous coins like Monero, we could see ISPs blocking or heavily throttling cryptocurreny transactions in the near future.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

The system flagged my account thinking I was selling items worth $10000 in one week when I hadn't done so in the last 6 years I've held a PayPal account. (US account btw).

So I knew the developers didn't account for this shit when they released PayPal Crypto so I submitted the stuff for review with my photo ID and wrote ""PayPal Crypto"" for each crypto transaction BECAUSE WHAT ELSE could I say?

I called their phone and he said he's expedited the review. I went to sleep, the next day (today) my account is permanently limited due to ....

""After a review, we've decided to permanently limit your account due to potential risk. You’ll not be able to conduct any further business using PayPal.""

180 days hold on my $462 in my balance.

No appeals. No explanation. No consideration that their reviewer may be an ignorant 60 year old with no knowledge of PayPal's own crypto service. Whenever I've called their support about PayPal Crypto in the past they had no idea what I was talking about (even after weeks after release).

Now I haven't called yet because phone support is offline, but I'm writing this thread because many others will be in the same spot as I am.


How do we start our journey to get them to understand what the fuck they did. I genuinely 100% know I did nothing wrong and its a misunderstanding because they think I made  50+ buy/sell transactions in a span of 1 week of items, when its just crypto.

I know how bad PayPal is in resolving these things and I've used them regularly for everything.

***EDIT EDIT EDIT :***

I just spent 40 minutes on the phone with a nice lady (Jennifer) on PayPal's phone and went through our transaction history/activity, tons of explanations of crypto terms (since she didn't know PayPal even has crypto) and I basically begged for the account back, but **still no luck because apparently you cannot appeal a final reviewed decision.**  

She genuinely wanted to help me and I believe she understood how crazy this ban was because I didn't sell items to anyone except PayPal (PayPal shows as the buyer and seller when you purchase from 'PayPal Crypto'). She finally understood it was a daytrading like thing and even after that there's no appeal option (she tried) and its final.

My last try would be to spam twitter, file consumer financial bureau mistakes and make coindesk-like articles to spread information and save others.

There is no real justice for the innocents in some places in the world.

Itinerary of a crypto idiot,1931,kxs9er,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kxs9er/itinerary_of_a_crypto_idiot/,554,1610736767.0,"There are lots of success stories around here, and sometimes an ""how did you get rekt?"" thread. But have you consistently been so bad at crypto that it made you laugh out loud and call yourself a dummy? So I thought it'd be cathartic to go down memory lane and write down my painful crypto story, which, as the post title says, is pretty much a textbook guide of what NOT to do. You can read, laugh and who knows, maybe even learn something.

&nbsp;

1) I bought the literal top in December 2017. You know that running joke in crypto how a coin tanks as soon as you buy it? My first BTC buy was on December 16th 2017. Check the charts. I sometimes wonder if I single-handedly fucked the market.


2) I initially bought BTC and ETH. As I was an early adopter of the ""buy high sell low"" philosophy, I panic sold my BTC shortly after. Then I proceeded to use my precious ETH to chase pumps and shilled shitcoins, signing up left and right on obscure exchanges in the process, and you guessed it, always buying the top of trending alts. To name a few of my shiny early acquisitions: BNTY, DBC, PRL. Thanks /r/cryptocurrency daily discussions!


3) In my everlasting quest to being a super early adopter and smarter than everyone, I had an ICO phase. What's an ICO phase you ask? That's when you share a photo of your passport and your face with complete strangers on the Internet (KYC process, for those unfamiliar), in order to obtain the privilege to invest in their Initial (Shit)Coin Offering, supposedly at bottom price, before they're listed on any exchanges, with little to no guarantees that they're even legit. 
I did however always do diligent research: I ensured the project websites had cool animations and logos, that they used words like ""industry-disruptive"", and that their subreddit top 10 posts of all times had at least 9 hysterical price predictions. What do I have to show for it? The pride to have sponsored the lavish lifestyle of some ""blockchain entrepreneurs"", and that my passport is probably used nowadays to rent hookers in Moldova.


4) I stayed too long involved in idealistic and promising, but dying projects (Elastos, Elix, HorizonState, FunFair, Babb). I am ashamed just writing those names down.


5) I bought literal scams, like XTRABYTES and SUBSTRATUM. I'm only missing BITCONNECT for scam bingo. If you guys have a bridge to sell, let me know, I might be interested.


6) The few successes I had, I was too greedy and didn't cash out any profits. I saw NANO do an 8X, then watched it crash back to below my buy price, with a surprised pikachu face all the way up, and all the way down. I by the way almost lost all my Railblocks in the Bitgrail disaster, but thankfully transferred them right before it happened (possibly my ""smartest"" move to date, completely accidental).


7) I screwed up some decimals when placing orders on IDEX, buying for way higher than market price.

8) I placed some buy orders that never filled because I had set them as Limit instead of Market. God I've done this so many times. I was once even so dumb that I contacted Binance customer service to ask why the order didn't fill…


9) During a coin swap process, I lost private wallet keys, and wrongly updated my passphrase.


10) I wasted so much in transfer fees moving coins in and out of MEW and between exchanges back and forth, most of the time for no good reason.


11) I signed up for all kinds of worthless airdrops that only filled my mailbox with spam.


12) And last but not least, the grand finale: I bought a ledger, but never used it! That's right, I was going be a millionaire, you see, I had to get ready to store all that digital gold. It's still in its plastic wrapping, in my bedside table drawer, staring at me like the [disappointed cricket fan meme](https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sarim-Akhtar.jpg) every time I open it.

&nbsp;

Now, what I did right (I think):

- I DCAed for a while after the early 2018 crash. As it kept crashing, I eventually stopped throwing good money after bad.


- Whatever shitcoins I had that still had value, I converted them to serious projects like ETH and VET, and I held.


- I fucking stopped trading. How I thought this was something I could do, having literally zero experience on financial markets, is hilarious in retrospect.


- During the long winter bear, I looked at prices only weekly, and kept up to date with general news, but without obsessing. A bit like polishing your meat to an ex-girlfriend you stayed in good terms with, but without the tears.

- I did a lot of reading on crypto throughout the whole ordeal. It's fascinating and despite my financial misfortunes, I'm a firm believer in the future of crypto.


- I bought some ETH when it dropped to $150 early 2020.


- I'm the proud owner of 5000 DOGE.

&nbsp;

Where am I now? Almost breaking even. It took more than three years in the red, but thanks to DCA, holding, and sticking to solid projects, I stayed afloat and it will eventually, hopefully, make up for all the stupid mistakes I made. When I finally break even, I'll reduce my position, keep some ETH, post on crypto forums what a boss I am for being in the green, and that will be the end of a rather long and agonizing learning experience.

Thank you for reading :]

Issue:

Hi-  I know it's a really busy time but I've been trying to get this issue  resolved for 4+ months with no luck. Here's my last shot.

In  early 2017 I created a binance account and bought some ADA/BNB and  never really checked it until Jan 2021. I can still log into the binance  account because I have my orig logon info, google 2fa set up, and a sms  number registered with the account.

Apparently  after 6months of inactivity the email address I registered with Binance  had expired. This was the email I used to get my withdraw pins.   Because I can't get withdraw pins, I cannot make withdraws.

To set up a new email I need to be verified. Binance will not verify me since I am a US citizen.

All  I would like to do is get my coins moved from Binance to BinanceUS so I  can withdraw them. I have tried to contact both Binance and BinanceUS  but neither are able to assist apparently.  I was told my coins were  ""safe"" but I literally can't withdraw them.

I'm  not here to bash binance or to bring them negative attention but I do  need help with this and I do not feel like I was getting the required  level of support in my emails to resolve this. Is anyone here familiar  with the process or able to share their experience? Thank you

&#x200B;

edit--Thank you so much to everyone who is commenting/upvoting for visibility!! I really appreciate the attention people are showing this post. I'll go through the comments and try some of the methods after work. This really is a great community.

Things you NEED to do when you first receive your hardware wallet,1921,lkssul,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lkssul/things_you_need_to_do_when_you_first_receive_your/,336,1613468820.0,"With so many new people in the crypto space, there are many mistakes that have been made that new investors need to know about.

One of them is what to do with your hardware wallet when you first receive it.

#Legitimate devices

In 99%+ of cases (99% is a low estimate) you will receive a legitimate hardware wallet. However, there have been cases of fake Ledger/Trezor wallets, or even wallets already set up (more on this below).

[How to ensure your Ledger is genuine](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002481534-Check-if-device-is-genuine).

[How to ensure your Trezor is genuine](https://blog.trezor.io/psa-non-genuine-trezor-devices-979b64e359a7).

These steps are particularly important if you buy from places like Amazon where there is very little individual stock quality control.

#Your seed

When setting up your hardware wallet for the first time, you will be generating a **BRAND NEW SEED**. If you did not do this step during the setup, it's possible that someone has set it up, hoping you don't notice.

They then monitor your wallet for transactions and drain your wallet.

Every wallet has a process of generating your seed, then displaying it for you to record. This applies to every type of wallet, so if this isn't something you did you should investigate ASAP as your funds may be at risk.

#Factory reset

After you have properly set up your new wallet and have noted down your seed, it's time to wipe your device. **Yes, this is necessary.**

Before sending a single transaction to your new address, factory reset your device and recover it using your seed. This ensures you have noted down your seed correctly and you are **capable** of restoring your wallet if it gets damaged or stolen.

I personally know people who had no trouble setting up their wallet, but needed a lot of help recovering it. Practicing this with a zero-balance wallet is an extremely valuable exercise.

This is such an important step that too many people don't do. Always practice disaster recovery as hardware devices will always eventually fail. It may be 15 years from now, but hardware doesn't last the test of time.

Also worth noting - your seed can be used to recover your wallet across another medium. For example, the seed from your Trezor can be put into a desktop wallet like Exodus and you will be able to access everything.",2021-02-16 03:47:00

By far the worst crypto conference I’ve been to. The networking was fine. Here’s why the actual conference sucked:    
    
1. Talks were superficial, and they didn’t seem to know who their audience was. Sorry folks, normies are gone. Speak to your core enthusiasts.    

2. The whole presentation vibe was, let’s bend over backward for bankers and discuss how we’re going to do it. I get that it’s in nyc, but come on. If the suits are here, let’s discuss using their money to lobby congress in favor of crypto instead of shorting the market.    

3. Presenters rehashed cliche after cliche, “muh 90% of icos will fail.” Instead of delving into the fundamental problems facing crypto (real world usage by the average joe, scalability, centralization).    

Not to mention how disorganized everything was.    
    
It was embarrassing for crypto. The market spoke.

I was too young to get into it in 2009, 2013 or 2017. But ever since I learned about dollar cost averaging, my life has profoundly changed. I had worked different jobs before, sometimes part time, sometimes full time, but last October I started a new job and with the money I earned from that I was able to invest in crypto. 

I realised today that not only has this money that I invested in BTC, ETH and then a few of the more dominant altcoins led to profits from me [albeit as of yet unrealised], but the money that I have dollar cost averaged this entire time, almost six months ago, is money that, prior to getting into cryptocurrency, when I was working other jobs and stuff, I would have simply spent on alcohol or clothes or whatever. For the first time in my life, this is the most money I have ever had to my name. And don't get me wrong, it's not a lot of money by most standards, but it's life changing or me to be able to see that discipline and restraint can lead to a fund that I can fall back on. Not only is crypto an investment for me, but it's also causing me to save money I would otherwise spend, and is making me more financially secure because of it.

Just wondering if any of you have experienced the same thing?",2021-03-10 03:13:08

Cryptocurrencies are open and permissionless. That's kinda the whole point. You can send money to anyone, anytime. You can trade on centralized platforms or directly peer-to-peer. It's totally up to you.

If some exchange prevents trading, you can always trade somewhere else. They can't stop decentralized networks. If you hold your own keys (cryptography that allows you to send and receive funds), you have freedom to do whatever you want with your money.

But... pump and dump groups are not good. r/CryptoCurrency is ***NOT*** a pump and dump group.

Cryptocurrencies have seen their fair share of pumps and dumps. The distributed nature of them mean that anyone can attempt these at any time. Experienced cryptocurrency traders are extremely familiar with them, since they happen all the time. It's normal to see random ""altcoins"" appreciate or depreciate more than 100% in a single day. That's normal here. Everything is 100x.

We encourage you to learn about cryptocurrencies and to take advantage of their freedom and censorship-resistant properties. But please, follow our rules. Us moderators take the role of preventing manipulation here (of all types) extremely seriously.

#Preamble 

Many people are hearing about crypto and want to buy in. Well, after a fair warning about the risks, it's always best to give them some guidance on what to look for if they're really eager to invest. 

In this post I'll try my best to note some of the simplest indicators anyone can look for when looking to open a long position on any coin. A very common mistake people make is to only look at a single indicator when buying cryptocurrency. But in reality, there's a multitude of indicators you should be looking into when buying in to any coin. So if a coin seems to be doing well in all of the indicators I'll list, then at the very least you're reducing your chances to get burned. 

#Bad FOMO

First, let's list some commonly heard misconceptions about what would make a coin a good buy: 

* *That coin only costs 0.02$? Buy it, it can 10x.*

* *This fell 50% today, buy it!*

* *This coin is rising like crazy, good chance to jump in for some profits.*

* *Everyone is talking about this coin so it must be good*


If taken individually, these are not great indications to open a long position on any coin, for reasons I'll try to explain in the following points. In the following part I'll try to put them in a list for the sake of simplicity. 

#Market Indicators & historical data

## 1. **Look at the volumes** 

It's really important to look into if there's a solid market behind a coin. If current volumes are really small, then the price is very prone to manipulation. 

**How to look into this?** Go into Coinmarketcap or Coingecko and have a look at historical volumes by hovering on the charts at a coin's page. This is better to be done on a desktop computer/laptop. Phone/tablet doesn't work so well for getting info out of the chart. 

## 2. **Look at the coins in circulation and release schedule**
 
It's really important to look at how many coins there are, how many there will ever be, and how fast coins are released. This is one of the reasons why buying a coin based on it having a low price per coin alone isn't a good idea. If many coins are to be released in the near future, it's very much likely that there's going to be a lot of selling pressure from those earning them. And if a coin is in its early release phases, emission is likely to be happening at a higher rate, so from monetary terms, prices would stabilize once emission is reduced. 

**How to look into this?** Coinmarketcap shows the total coins in circulation currently, as well as the maximum amount of coins there will ever be. And they're a third party source so they largely have no incentive to lie. You can trust them over a coin's developers for instance. Too look into this on your own, go into a coin's page on Coinmarketcap. *Circulating Supply* means how many coins are released on the market right now. *Max Supply* means how many coins there can ever be. To look into how fast coins are released you can Google something like ""[coin name] emission schedule"". This should bring up some info on how a coin is planned to continue being 'minted'. It can vary a lot from coin to coin so always do your own research, find up to date sources and double check so you understand everything correctly. 

## 3. **Check the listings**

If a coin is only listed on very few exchanges, it's very much likely that it doesn't have a solid market behind it. Its price could be manipulated easily and when only a few exchanges trade a coin you should be suspicious of high volumes. 

**How to look into this?** Go to the Coinmarketcap page for a coin, click on ""Market"" and see the exchange pairs. Pay special attention at how the volumes are distributed and what the ""Confidence"" rating for each exchange says. If a coin is receiving most of its volumes on low rated exchange it might be a good idea to stay away. 

## 4. **Pair variety**

If a coin has a great variety of pairs to be traded with, it's a very good indicator that there's demand to trade with it. Especially if there are many FIAT pairs for it, across several exchanges, this is a great case for a coin having people interested in it worldwide. 

**How to look into this?** In the Coinmarketcap ""Market"" page for a coin, see how many different pairs there are. To look out for FIAT pairs more directly you can also filter pairs at the top right by selecting EUR or USD etc. You can also click ""Load More"" for a fuller picture.  

## 5. **Historical price**

This is perhaps the single most important indicator when going in to a coin. No matter if the price per coin looks low for example, if the coin is at an all time high when you're buying, then this is one indicator showing it's hard for the coin to go up further. You can also compare the current price with different time periods. For example, last 7 days, month, year etc. Important to also look for historical volumes and compare in relation to historical prices. 

When doing this, it's also important to check the market's history and look for some important related metrics. Like: What's the All Time High? Has the coin been above current prices many times (and if yes, how much trading volume did it take to break above the price level)? What's the relation of the previous ATH with the current price? 

**How to look into this?** Simply go into the page of a coin on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko and look at historical prices. 

## 6. **Market capitalization value**

This is an important indicator. It's showing the total value of all the coins in circulation, usually measured in FIAT (USD). But there are also some related metrics that might make the market cap value unreliable. For instance: If the market cap went up by a lot due to a nearly vertical price rise recently then it's not very representative of a market's substance. You should try to consider the market cap before an ongoing *pump* for something more representative. Also, if a coin's market cap value is high with tiny volumes compared to coins of a similar market cap value, then this can be a red flag. 

The *coin* market cap is also a limitation to how much a coin's price could rise. A golden rule of thumb over this issue is that no coin should ever be expected to surpass bitcoin in market cap value. So in simple terms, the result of the formula 

    coins * price 

will never be more than bitcoin's market cap value (in $). Consider this a hard limit to how much a coin can rise in value. And by this point I think that you should also consider any price prediction according to which a coin would come near ETH's market cap value as unsubstantiated, grossly speculative and wildly inaccurate. In most occasions, this can be used to debunk claims that a coin can go *10x*, which is a very common attempt driving FOMO panic buying for a coin. 

**How to look into this?** Just go to coinmarketcap.com's main page and/or the specific coin's page and see how that coin ranks.

PSA: Do not tell people you own crypto or how much you own,1891,mj6ejy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mj6ejy/psa_do_not_tell_people_you_own_crypto_or_how_much/,552,1617476589.0,"I have recently been downvoted for saying that you can have all your crypto stolen by someone forcing you to reveal your 12 seed words. Perhaps in more civilized countries robberies and murder for money is not as common but for the rest of us who may not come from places as nice this is a danger.

Wallets can be recreated with the 12 ""seed"" words that are used to recover wallets even when lost. If word goes around that you have a lot of crypto the wrong people might hear about it and decide to pay you a visit. You may not know what those words are, or as someone suggest, offer a secondary wallet up instead of the primary one but that's not fool proof. They might decide to actually kill you after giving the secondary or be smart enough to know there should be more and continue asking you for another wallet. They might receive your primary and straight up assume it's not enough and has to be the secondary.

Yes, this is not a problem now for you and your $4,000 in crypto but 4 years from now you will be the guy who talked about bitcoin when it was 20 times (if being generous) less. They won't know if you sold or not and bad actors will assume you've continued adding funds through out that time.

Be smart and be safe. Advise family and friends if asked but crypto currencies are big enough now for even your grandmother to have asked you about them.

The Absolute Fucking Impossibility of Reporting Taxes On This Shit,1889,7m56g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m56g0/the_absolute_fucking_impossibility_of_reporting/,1048,1514284478.0,"**EDIT: PLEASE STOP ASKING ME FOR DAY-TRADING TIPS. LEARN BY DOING.**

I'm in the US. I day-trade cryptocurrencies and have made tens of thousands of orders across many pairs and exchanges (and have made substantially more than I would have by just ""hodl xd"", even with short-term penalty added, thank you very much). Uncle Sam wants his pie. Okay, fine. I know exactly how much I've made by simply tallying the deposits and withdrawals from by bank to my fiat gateways, and I'm willing to be taxed on that, but...

The IRS expects me to report every single transaction on a form *with each interval gain and loss step reported in USD*. Every single one of my tens of thousands of orders and partial trades, most of which having no actual valuation or realization in USD, yet somehow I'm expected to calculate the imaginary USD gain/loss of each when BTC/USD fluctuates by whole percents every other minute on the reference fiat exchange (GDAX, say). No matter what painstaking diligence is paid to reporting the notional USD gain/loss for every alt pair and perpetual swap trade by cross-referencing those irrelevant data points, **I will inevitably end up with a totally fictional sequence of numbers that deviates significantly from my known, actual USD gain from what hit my fucking bank and what is presently on my exchange accounts.** This especially when transaction and trading and funding fees are taken into account, as well as the nightmare of slippage and partial fills.

Also Bittrex completely wiped out my trade history, and everyone else's from what I hear, but my deposits/withdrawals are still there and that should really be all that matters (but not to the IRS apparently). I also had a stint on poswallet.com, same situation.

Now here's the mind-melting part: I use BitMEX. I've made most of my gains from there. (Yes, I know that US customers are ostensibly disallowed by BitMEX from using BitMEX, but we all know this is lip service, and it is not illegal in itself by US law to violate a site's T&S, and honestly BitMEX rocks so hard I'd be willing to set up an offshore company to keep using it). The [IRS virtual currency guidance](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf) defines cryptocurrency as ""property"" and seems to concern itself with ""exchange of virtual currency for other property"", which is taxable. Okay, but is a perpetual swap or futures contract taxable? How is it possible to calculate the ""cost basis"" of a BitMEX position, where posted margin can arbitrarily and dynamically scale? No actual buying or selling of bitcoin occurs on BitMEX, so how is it taxable? How is it reportable? How?

How the fuck do I even report any kind of short position on [Form 8949](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf)? This would apply to Poloniex and Bitfinex as well.

The IRS stipulates different (and highly favorable) tax rules for conventional futures trading, such as the 60/40 rule, where as I understand it 60 percent of futures gains are considered long-term and 40 percent are considered short-term, as marked-to-market. Would this apply to BitMEX futures as well? And how about when, at the end, you withdraw your bitcoin from there and it becomes ""property"" again to sell for fiat?

Even if I went to a tax attorney or CPA, as I intend to do, would they know more than me what with the terribly incomplete guidance the IRS has given about all this? Nevermind the logistical insanity of the step-by-step fictional USD conversion process. And forget about bitcoin.tax; they don't handle BitMEX or any kind of serious trading activity.

I've made a lot of money. I'm fine with being taxed fairly on my net gain. But the IRS has not adequately addressed the problems I have described in their guidance. What the hell do I do?",2017-12-26 04:34:38

My experience reading the Bitcoin white paper on different drugs,1876,n442xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n442xu/my_experience_reading_the_bitcoin_white_paper_on/,368,1620096707.0,"I made more money picking stocks when high than I ever did sober. I thought it would be a good idea to read the Bitcoin white paper while on different drugs. Obligatory note: this is for informational purposes, I don’t recommend you do drugs. Here’s my experience:

**Weed, 0.4g indica dominant**

Made me feel like I understood what I was reading. But really I was forgetting every sentence after starting the next. Terrible for comprehension and no value add. Might be better to have a conversation with someone about crypto rather than reading. 

**Alcohol, 4 drinks**

I’m actually allergic to alcohol so I get really bad flush and I can hear my heartbeat. This was worse than weed - I didn’t even try to get past the first paragraph. I was just breathing heavily and staring at words.

**LSD, 200 ug**

I had to wait until AFTER the peak. Words fly around and would be impossible to read during the peak + thought loops - I didn’t want to be stuck thinking about blockchain for an hour thinking about blockchain for an hour. After the peak I started reading, the letters still wobble but it’s readable. I felt blockchain was the product of human greed - no need for blockchain if financial institutions were honest and not-for-profit instead of trying to profit off every damn fee. Would do LSD again when researching other stuff as it gives you a perspective you hadn’t thought about. 

**Adderall, 30mg**

Definitely works as you might imagine. I had low tolerance since it had been a long time - actually took a little too much and ended up getting too euphoric. I had waves of pleasure hitting me as I tried to read. After that I was able to focus and read all the way through. Useful if you need to do research on a bunch of coins in a small timeframe. 

**Ketamine, 4 bumps**

I did 1 line waited a few minutes and turned on those lofi coding playlists on YouTube. Music sounded too good. Took another line and started reading. Idk it felt like my brain was sort of jumbled and I didn’t care to read the white paper all that much. Did two more lines while enjoying the music. Ended up in a khole and obviously didn’t finish. But IT was cool, I “saw” the blockchain. Bad for reading.

**Cocaine, all night**

I kind of imagined it would be like adderall where I would get focused enough to read in the beginning. Ended up just doing the entire bag in one night and talking with my flat mate about financial freedom and how I would create the next coinbase / binance. Now that I’m sober, no I won’t lol

EOS will be extremely centralised with 21 handpicked nodes,1882,8fit8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8fit8s/eos_will_be_extremely_centralised_with_21/,794,1524935697.0,"EOS will be extremely centralised. 21 nodes is a paltry sum. Non-full-nodes will not have any way to do lightweight verification, thus multiplying its degree of centralisation.

On top of all of this, the 21 full nodes will be delegates, which are voted in. By necessity, this turns consensus into a political process instead of an automated one. One of the practical effects of this is that the delegate nodes will be known/trusted third parties.

To sum up, EOS will be a trusted third party based ledger. Eliminating the need for trusted third parties was the great breakthrough that Satoshi made in inventing the PoW blockchain, and which Ethereum is putting all this work into to try to replicate with Proof of Stake.

TTP-based ledgers do not have the high assurance of immutability of permissionless Byzantine fault tolerant ones like Ethereum. Therefore, they're not as attractive for new projects as a platform to launch on.


EOS is more like an attempt to create an evolved version of the traditional centralized server-client architecture rather than an attempt to introduce a paradigm shift like Ethereum.

Whenever there is a dip, some old hands decide to help out/motivate/karma-farm/act high and mighty...

These feel-good posts are all well and good, but once you've seen one, you've seen them all. So I'm going to *try* and add a bit more substance (though I am aware of the irony that I'm basically doing the same thing, only with better grammar and more references to peer-reviewed journals).

Informative posts tend to get downvoted to hell though, so who knows if this will even be seen. I spent a bit of time trying to put it together, so if you think it's useful, please do give an upvote for visibility.

##Tl;dr If you play it safe - with boring strategies, such as dollar-cost averaging, diversifying in high-cap tokens, and taking advantage of compound interest - you will probably still get massive return on investment.


Also, as I get older, I'm starting to realise a few years isn't *that* long. Traditional financial investment might make you rich over 30-40 years. I believe crypto can do it in 5-10. This might seem like a lot, but it's not. Stop thinking in days and weeks and start thinking in months and years.
.

**First, some data on trading:**

[The average individual investor underperforms a market index by 1.5% per year. Active traders underperform by 6.5% annually](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=219228)

[Profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders – 1.6% in the average year.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/529c/ce873471d616cb0778e224fa8060785f13d6.pdf?_ga=2.168609569.1460452885.1606468814-1953133549.1606468814)

[The typical day trader loses
money by a considerable margin after adjusting for transaction costs](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.533.2044%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&ved=2ahUKEwijwLr5s6LtAhUTWsAKHe1xBgEQFjALegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw2pVZbTXvySyiRdLNkb6WQS)

Furthermore, the authors of the second study write that ""inconsistent with models of rational speculation and learning, we document that the aggregate performance of day traders is negative"".

This is all about regular stock trading, but you get the idea.
.


**Second, some anecdata about crypto friends:**

Maybe academic papers aren't your thing. Fair enough.

Back in 2017, two friends of mine got into crypto and we started a WhatsApp group to share tips. One friend invested steadily into Bitcoin and a few alts. The other friend invested heavily into altcoins and traded every day. In a bull market everybody thinks they're a genius. He made a lot of money then lost it all. In 2018, he tried to carry on trading, but this was now a bear market. He lost even more.

Fast forward to this year, and he's now anti-crypto. Regrets all the money he lost. Thinks it's all a scam. At the first sign of recovery, he converted the dregs of his altcoins to BTC, sold via Coinbase and left the chat. If he'd held on for another month or two he might have recouped some losses, but he didn't.

My other friend carried on DCA'ing into BTC and ETH and is now up considerably.
.


**Third, some cognitive biases**


[Survivorship bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) means that we concentrate on the people who win. See some smug bastard proclaiming his shitcoin profits in the Daily? He won. What you don't see are the hundreds of Wojaks who tried different trades and lost. Badly. You are more likely to be one of those sad fucks. Sorry.

[Hyperbolic discounting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting) is the preference for immediate payoffs to greater payoffs at a later date. Crypto is seen as a ""get rich quick"" scheme. If you're new to this game, reset your expectation to ""get rich more slowly than I'd like, but still fairly quick all things considered"" scheme and you'll do just fine.
.


**Next, some info on Dollar Cost Averaging:**

[Buying $100 of Bitcoin every month for 3 years starting 3 years ago would have turned $3,600 into $5,413 (+50%)](https://dcabtc.com?sd=2017-11-27&sda=3_years&f=monthly&d=3_years&ac=10000&c=false) 

That might not sound like much but the point is that *even if* you had bought bitcoin near the absolute peak, you would still be 50% up by now. That is INSANELY good.

Let's play around a bit more.

[ Dollar cost averaging Bitcoin biweekly from 07/09/2016 to 11/27/2020 gave 526.26% ROI](https://www.bitcoindollarcostaverage.com) and you would now own 4.3 BTC. 2016 was early, but it shows how a little time in the market works.
.


**Can you beat the market by buying the market?**

[Check out the top ten crypto fund posts.](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) 
The answer is... *probably*.

There is a lot of data to comb through here and I bloody love this guy's monthly updates. They're honestly the best posts on this whole subreddit.

I hope he doesn't mind me attempting to summarize, but the main points appear to be:

* BTC and ETH have generally outperformed the other picks
* Crypto is still beating the stock market
* (This depends on buy-in times)
* Despite it being a three-year bear market
* The upside in a bull market is huge.
.


**Longterm predictions**

Mathematical analysis of crypto gets a bad rap. John McAfee famously got it wrong. But that doesn't mean it's all nonsense. Patterns tend to repeat.

[Here are various predictions for a $100,000 Bitcoin.](https://www.moonmath.win/)

The logarithmic regression band shows a steady upward trend, with decreasing volatility. It's a reasonable assumption that this will continue. There will be bubbles, there will be corrections, but BTC will continue going up. And if you iron out the swings, it will give greater returns than any other asset class. Crypto as a whole will also go up and other coins will give even greater return. These will be hard to predict. Diversifying a small amount into a few other coins will give some exposure to this effect without too much risk.
.


**Finally, some thoughts on compounding**

OK, not your keys, not your crypto. 

But... Someone once said compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world and the key to wealth.

The reason for the boom this summer is DeFi. For the first time, it's possible to earn interest on crypto. There are risks involved, but it is a force multiplier that can massively improve your success, and it would be remiss of you to not consider it.

Compound interest is great on its own. But using compound interest to accumulate more units of an asset that is itself appreciating, will accelerate the process dramatically.

Consider the following:

* You bought one Bitcoin at $10,000.
* You HODL for ten years and it reaches $100,000.
* Go you.

Or:

* You put that Bitcoin into DeFi/CeFi
* You get 6.5% compounding interest.
* You HODL for ten years and BTC reaches $100,000
* But you now have 1.91 BTC
* You have $191,000
* That's 19x your initial buy-in. Nearly twice as good as just HODLING.

I urge you to play around with [a compound interest calculator](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php).

If nothing else, it should show you the value of thinking in longer timeframes.

Currently, the best bank accounts are offering under 1% interest. Which means you're actually losing money after inflation. On the other hand, staking is coming to Eth and DeFi isn't going anywhere. There are risks with DeFi, and using crypto custodians is philosophically at odds with the dream of pseudonymous digital cash. 

That's for you to think about. But use the calculator above, plug in some numbers, and see where 12% interest gets you in 20 years. Even if you just used fiat, that would get you pretty far. Now think about getting even 5% return on Eth or BTC. Now think about what 1 BTC or 1 ETH will be worth then. Factor in dollar cost averaging on top of that. And you're risking it all chasing pumps every day? 

Slow down, and consider the safe, boring, options. You might be surprised where you get to in a few years.

*Edit - A few people have pointed out, rightly, that I underplayed the risk of DeFi. I agree that lending your money to a custodian or a random smart contract is a risky play. But the potential of compound interest over time is an exciting development in this space, and possibly safer than day-trading. But only if you're comfortable. DYOR into DeFi and PoS coins.*",2020-11-27 13:18:51

Tether was hacked by the same person who hacked Bitstamp in 2015,1849,7eho5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/,312,1511298153.0,"Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I think these payments were to ensure that they had BTC available to pay the fees needed to move that Tether as soon as they got it*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016

The BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:

https://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua

https://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB

https://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC out of Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/02f08eddae4ba788

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/f4b4c44dd6a146fd

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/0e9ae0a86dafc3a8dde0578871e51212c1e962ebf5a3306904b4e2eca25e0ba6

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

I made 7500 USD on UNISWAP and I didn’t even know it !,1849,lfzw3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lfzw3g/i_made_7500_usd_on_uniswap_and_i_didnt_even_know/,300,1612895262.0,"Craziest story of my life. How I made 7500 dollars while chilling at home at 2 AM In the morning. I am an amateur crypto trader. I buy and sell all the time and I spend hours digging looking for new coins to buy. Last year I used uniswap to buy a token that was only available there. it was only one transaction and I didn’t really care much and totally forgot about the app. Fast forward to today , I decided to get back into crypto. I did some homework and found a couple good gems to buy on uniswap so I decide to open the app. 

I initiated  the transaction and I looked down to a button that says uniswap. I didn’t know what it was so I ignored it and my transaction failed. So I tried again and I was like meh I’ll just click it and see what it’s in it. 

As soon as I open it and I get the message “claim your 400 UNISWAP” and I was completely shocked. 

I owned the 400 from the airdrop since last year and I didn’t even know it!!!! And I rode it from 2 dollars all the way to 19.55 today! Imagine if I found out about it sooner I would’ve probably sold around 3 or 4 dollars (I know myself) but instead I rode it like a champ at a 524% increase ! Holy fucking shit. This just happened a few minutes ago and I thought this is the place to share such story

Edit: earlier today my wife and I were stressing about our 1 bed room apartment since we have a baby coming on the way. We were planning to buy a house in August but this money will pull our date to may which will be perfect and right before our baby gets here! 
I am very grateful and I CANT WAIT to tell my wife in the morning.

Edit2: THANK YOU ALL! You guys are amazing! I appreciate all the awards and the support

Edit3: 4 people claimed their 400 UNISWAP after they saw the post! This is AMAZING!",2021-02-09 12:27:42

My story of becoming a crypto millionaire and “poor” again,1809,bogyjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bogyjm/my_story_of_becoming_a_crypto_millionaire_and/,435,1557857323.0,"I am writing this now from my phone, sitting in a bar in the slums of East Africa, enjoying my $0.60 beer in the shadow.

Here is my story.
I was working for a bank in Europe when a colleague told me about Ethereum end of 2016. That’s when I invested blindly what I had left from my savings. Boy I had no idea. It went well as you might know. I also had the right timing when I switched from Ethereum to EOS one year later. My initial investment was suddenly worth about almost 100x in a liquid market. Worth about a million. I didn’t tell anyone about that apart of my parents, my best friend and the colleague who told me about crypto.

That’s when my parents started asking me for help. And I was glad I was able to help. They are divorced and asked both separately. Soon I was also requested to help more family members, also outside of my country. My dad told everyone that his son is rich now. I was his best bank. I lend some 5-digits here and there I think. I don’t even know how much exactly. I never got back anything after a year and I don’t think I ever will. Also waiting 2 years already for some money I lend out.

I felt like...if nobody gives me back anything I need to make it back myself. I started gambling with DICE and EOSbet cryptocasino. And I did well for many months. I won about 9,000 EOS  with a careful strategy, a lot more EOS in the back and a lot of luck during this period. Then I lost all profits again with EOSbet within one day.
Until here it wasn’t even bad. I lost as much as I won. But also the crypto market had a serious pullback and my EOS weren’t worth as much anymore.

I got emotional after this step backwards and market-bought DICE at the wrong time, all in. I lost another big chunk there on top of the general crypto pullback. All this gave me so much stress for about a month. I also couldn’t carry the financial burdens of my parents and family on a monthly basis anymore. Not this frequent...

I felt like I don’t want to care about money anymore. It didn’t really make me happy, I didn’t really use it myself anyway. It created only problems because suddenly so many people had financial problems and literally begged me for help.

During all this time I was still living in my 2 room student apartment, without a kitchen or tv. I am 29 now and I never even afforded a car. 

2 months ago I decided to just quit everything and leave the country to have my peace. I quit my job because it wasn’t fun anymore and I didn’t care about the salary or money in general anymore. 

Now I am living amongst the poorest people on earth here in Africa and I am more happy than all those months before when I was living in Europe with all this money (on the paper).

This journey completely changed how I perceive money and how I value it.

Now let me have another beer. The weather is good and I finally started enjoying my life without any pressure. Still hodlin the rest of my investment in DICE and if it completely gets rekt and falls to 0 I am fine with it. I have found my peace here now, with money or without.

"IMPORTANT for all EU citizens! It is time to come together. Since today, you can DIRECTLY influence the future of the European Union and have a voice on cryptocurrency and blockchain regulations. This actually a big deal and has been two years in the making. Please read this post.",1808,mu4d6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mu4d6p/important_for_all_eu_citizens_it_is_time_to_come/,318,1618878343.0,"## The Conference on the Future of Europe has started! EU citizens can now officially propose ideas and voice their opinions on regulations, including on cryptocurrency and blockchain.

#### What is the Conference on the Future of Europe?

The Conference on the Future of Europe is a unique and timely opportunity for European citizens to debate on Europe’s challenges and priorities. No matter where you are from or what you do, this is the place to think about what future you want for the European Union.

The European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission have committed to listen to Europeans and to follow up, within their sphere of competences, on the recommendations made. 

European citizens, from all walks of life and corners of the Union, with young people playing a central role in shaping the future of the European project. 

#### How to propose ideas?

You can **propose** ideas, **discuss** ideas and **support** ideas on the online platform (in our case: ideas about cryptocurrency and blockchain): [https://futureu.europa.eu/](https://futureu.europa.eu/)

**If you start a discussion on cryptocurrency or blockchain, post it here:**

* Digital Transformation Category: [https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Digital](https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Digital)
* A Stronger Economy, Social Justice and Jobs Category: [https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Economy](https://futureu.europa.eu/processes/Economy)

*You can post ideas yourself or support ideas being posted by other EU citizens.* 

We, as a community, must come together to discuss and push for cryptocurrency and blockchain friendly ideas and regulations. This is a unique opportunity for us all. Since the Conference on the Future of Europe has just started (no one has mentioned cryptocurrency yet) we can set the agenda for the coming months. We would be the first community to get involved. **Our ideas will be heard by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission if they gather enough support.** 

I am calling upon the community, developers, mods and crypto projects to get involved and spread the word.",2021-04-19 19:25:43
