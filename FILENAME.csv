Wikileaks latest insurance files don't match hashes,4329,5cz1fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/5cz1fz/wikileaks_latest_insurance_files_dont_match_hashes/,1218,1479193212.0,"UPDATE: @Wikileaks has made a statement regarding the discrepancy.

https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/798997378552299521

>NOTE: When we release pre-commitment hashes they are for decrypted files (obviously). Mr. Assange appreciates the concern.

The statement confirms that the pre-commits are in fact, for the latest insurance files. As the links above show, Wikileaks has historically used hashes for encrypted files (since 2010). Therefore, the intention of the pre-commitment hashes is not ""obvious"". Using a hash for a decrypted file could put readers in danger as it forces them to open a potentially malicious file in order to verify if its contents are real. Generating hashes from encrypted files is standard, practical and safe. I recommend waiting for a PGP signed message from Wikileaks before proceeding with further communication. 

The latest insurance files posted by Wikileaks do not match the pre-commitment hashes they tweeted in October.

> If the question is does someone using a Wikileaks PGP key say anything at all - well it says that that person has control over the key. Nothing else.

**TLDR:** VoiceCrypt uses 256 bit XOR underneath and you can recover the shared profile key using known-plaintext techniques.

Here is the script: [https://gist.github.com/monoxgas/b0e3ec74bc3d190f76951ac1ac9b6f2a](https://gist.github.com/monoxgas/b0e3ec74bc3d190f76951ac1ac9b6f2a)

    [+] Dec: b'This is my secret documents thing.\r\n\r\nTesting VoiceCrypt and stuff.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is easy to recover!\r\n'

Took me all weekend, but I can indeed confirm the crypto in VoiceCrypt is terrible. Lots of reversing and coding, I've finished a script which can recover the profile key using known-plaintext techniques. I've commented the script somewhat to help describe the process. Currently it expects, for a given vtxt file, a matching txt file to use as the known-plaintext. With that said, there is also some code in there for performing english scoring if you just know the file is likely ASCII chars.

Essentially you generate a ""profile"" key (256 bit), and that key is used to XOR encrypt the original file data. This key is shared as long as the profile is the same. 

As far as the original /u/torindkflt is concerned, recovering the key will likely require some script modifications, using known structures/headers/contents of a Word 97 office document. Assuming the OP trusts me enough, I'd be happy to receive the actual file privately and work on recovery. Otherwise I wish you best of luck decrypting your file.",2020-12-14 21:52:06
Crypto News: German government is thinking about banning End-To-End encryption in certain cases,121,bu1enq,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/bu1enq/crypto_news_german_government_is_thinking_about/,51,1559086256.0,"The German government is thinking about creating a new law / law draft which should give the government the ability to force any Messenger company to disable End-To-End encryption for certain users without their consent. Then the companies will be forced to provide the plaintext chat messages to the government/police.
Messenger companies which do not comply, should/will be banned in the whole country, according to the plan of the government.

    <nick> A friend and I need to authenticate a person's name without sharing (to each other) the name of the person that we know.
    <nick> Person A has a name in their head, and Person B likewise - both would like to know if they are thinking of the same person
    <nick> but without diverging the name (in case they are thinking of different people).
    <nick> This requires a zero-knowledge proof.
    <nick> How can we conduct such a proof using simple mathematics? What is the least complicated way to do this?
    <user> well, I would make them hash their guess
    <user> kinda like sha2(""donaldtrump"")
    <user> if they both got the same hash, they're guess is the same
    <nick> Thanks. We actually used a sha512 hash of the person's facebook profile, firstname (lowercase) and lastname (lowercase)

>""It's easier to prove the \[Riemann Hypothesis\] than to get someone to read your proof!"" - [unknown](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/mrwatkin//zeta/RHproofs.htm)

Designers get a chance that somebody will actually honor their ideas with a review that may teach them about issues that they may not have thought about. Because even if they come up with something secure, the above quote sums up what will happen.

&#x200B;

>I remember a conversation in 1991 with Brian Snow, a highly placed senior cryptographer with the NSA. He said he would never trust an encryption algorithm designed by someone who had not ""earned their bones"" by first spending a lot of time cracking codes. That made a lot of sense. I observed that practically no one in the commercial world of cryptography qualifies under this criterion. ""Yes,"" he said with a self-assured smile, ""And that makes our job at NSA so much easier."" A chilling thought. I didn't qualify either. - [Phil Zimmermann](https://philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/SnakeOil.html)

Possibly even more interestingly, upcoming cryptanalysts get a chance to attack ciphers that are neither intentionally broken to demonstrate a certain attack, nor completely out of their league (attacking AES as a beginner is a useless waste of time) nor already broken by somebody else (which is less motivating than the chance to become the first).

To ease analysis a strict format of all proposed ciphers will be required, which will hopefully encourage more participation.

# 

# Rules for everyone

* There is one top-level-post for general discussion, aside from that all top-level-posts are reserved for presentations of primitives that follow the below format.
* All cryptographic primitives are acceptable, so even though the majority of posts will most likely be ciphers, hashfunctions are for example fine as well.
* Don't be under the illusion that anything here would hold up to proper cryptanalysis by nation-state-attackers, just because it didn't get broken here by more or less experienced people in their free-time.
* Depending on the volume of posts this post may be replaced with a new one every couple of months. Re-posting comprehensible but unbroken ciphers with a link to the previous post will be encouraged in that case.

# 

# Rules for cryptanalysis

* Create a child-post for every distinct attack you find.
* If you spend a significant time trying to break a primitive and failed, please post that as well together with everything you consider notable; a post “I tried to break this for 2 hours and failed” is still more useful than none as it provide guidance to which primitives might still be low-hanging-fruits and which are more likely to be challenging.
* Feel free to point out issues that are not relevant to the security-claims but could still bite people who would use it for real, as long as those issues have not been either mentioned or acknowledged in previous answers
* If your attack is complicated, you are encouraged (but not required) to write it down elsewhere and link to it if that helps readability (for example because of the support that LaTeX has for math).
* Even if the primitive is a mess, show respect for the attempt: „Wer kämpft kann verlieren. Wer nicht kämpft hat schon verloren“ - “He who fights can loose. He who doesn't fight has already lost”

# 

# Rules for posting a primitive

For every cipher (or other primitive) create one top-level post, which **must** have the following structure and include all listed points. Not following these rules might get your post removed (if you don't know where to host code and the description or have any other questions ask in the questions-thread in this post; also look at existing posts to get some idea for the intended structure):

* **Name**: *some name for the cipher (makes talking about it simpler, don't go too crazy here)*
* **Designer**: *Name of the designer and whether that is you (Posting a primitive of somebody else is generally discouraged, but may be acceptable under special circumstances)*
* **Kind of primitive**: *What kind of primitive are you presenting? A block-cipher, stream-cipher, hash-function, MAC, whatever?*
* **Pen and Paper**: *“yes” or “no”. Whether your primitive is intended to be usable without computers*
* **Security-claim**: *What notion of security does your primitive intend to provide? (For context: In theoretical cryptography it is sometimes harder to come up with a sensible notion of “secure” than it is to come up with a protocol that provides it.)*
* **Security-level**: *How much security (in bits) does your primitive intend to provide?  n bit of security means that breaking it takes at least 2^(n) operations too break. Modern primitives will usually want to have this at 128 bit.*
* **Overview**: *Describe in a couple of sentences the basic ideas behind your ciphers, to give readers a rough idea what to expect. Interesting information could for example be that your cipher uses a Feistel-structure with an ARX-round-function.*
* **Link to complete description**: *as the title says. This should link to a full description of your cipher that would allow anyone to implement it on just that document.*
* **Link to implementation**: *A link to the source-code of a working software-implementation of your cipher in a not too obscure programming-language in an easy to read,  download and build format; preferably a git-repository that can be cloned. (Use you own judgement for which languages are too obscure, but rest assured that if you use* [malbolge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge) *nobody will read it.)*
* **Intended parameters**: If your cipher is allows different parameters (for example round-count) the specific parameters that you believe to be secure.

Additionally you may add the following points:

* **Bounties**: *If you offer bounties for breaks (which is by no means even remotely required!), you may list them here with a precise definition for the circumstances under which you grant them.*
* **Previous Analysis**: *Whether somebody already looked at the cipher, what they found and what you yourself already tried.*
* **Promising attack-vectors**: *If you have an idea for some kind of cryptanalysis that might yield fast results, feel free to mention them*

For everything else (for example the story of the cipher), add an answer to your top-level-post to keep that one short and to the point. (If the story is interesting, it may be double the karma for you! ;-))

Once you've done that, be prepared to answer open questions and acknowledge any attacks somebody might find. Be open to any issues others might find and try to learn from them instead of insisting on riding a dead horse.

&#x200B;

# Tips for designers

The following are not mandatory rules but you might still want to follow them:

* Using round-based primitives makes analysis much easier and allows to quantify margins and alike. If you want to get good replies, this is most likely the way to go.
* Side-channel-attacks are a thing. You can probably trust that bitwise operations (and, or, xor, shifts, rotations) and addition are safe to use, but almost everything else has the potential to leak information making your cipher immediately very hard to use safely in the real world, even if it was secure. Note that this means that s-boxes are usually a very bad idea.
* Boasting about your new cipher being the greatest and selling it to some secret service will only get you laughed out as a crank and then ignored. Show some humility and assume that your cipher is insecure so you can be proud if it isn't shredded in the first couple of days and don't have to get sad if it doesn't.
* If you want to design a cipher, block-ciphers are sufficient building-block that can be easily crafted as [Feistel-ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher) or [Substitution-permutation-networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network).
* Pen-and-paper ciphers are an interesting topic without too much research and giving them a try is very much encouraged. **But**: If you believe that they are still relevant for actual use these days, think about how suspicious it is to have a smart-phone on you that is capable of encrypting more text in a couple of seconds than you will read in your entire live. The answer will probably be something like “not at all”, which happens to be more or less the answer for how useful pen-and-paper-crypto is in real-life. Of course this doesn't mean that they aren't very exciting from an academic perspective, which is a totally valid reason to invent them. Just don't misunderstand their relevance.

Sys. admin in a bit of a pickle with backup of a passcode program that doesn't work on iOS 11 and doesn't exist in the app store anymore,85,7empae,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/7empae/sys_admin_in_a_bit_of_a_pickle_with_backup_of_a/,34,1511339796.0,"tl;dr: I have a backup file from an iPhone app iPasscode, a deprecated app that is no longer on the app store, developer is AWOL, Apple sends me to developer, trying to figure it out myself as it contains a bunch of stuff for a client. Inane examples below


Hi! I'm a systems admin in a small MSP that manages mostly windows environments. Server setup, basic things, etc etc. I understand the uber basics of how cryptographic algorithms work (I think),  a client hit me with a curve ball and I want to help him but really don't know where to start as this quickly went above my level of knowledge.


Client had a program on iPhone called iPasscode. This program predates iOS 11, so it's 32-bit. As such, when client upgraded from 10.x to 11.x, the program ceased to function. The developer has gone AWOL and pulled it from the app store, Apple sends me in a loop to try to contact the aforementioned developer, clients backup situation was non-existent (it was a BYOD and we remedied that, but too little too late).


During the process of the iOS 11 upgrade, client was asked to backup the database from iPasscode. He obliged, and proceeded to send me a file called backup_local.ipb


I opened it in notepad just to see what it is, and the format is loosely this:


1:Base64 name of entry:username:password:note
2:... 
etc 


I'd never really delved into trying to decrypt or whatever things before, so I found a bunch of sites that helped figured out what the type of encryption/hash was and that's how I was able to figure out what the Base64 thing was. Example


1:Q2hhc2UgTUM=
I was able to use John's Base64 decoder to figure out that was Chase MC


The same decoding would not work on what I assume are usernames or passwords, but would work on some of the ancillary text: eg 'cat's name'. Here's an example of one of the ancillary texts:


V1BBL1dQQTI=
That comes back as: WPA/WPA2


I know some of the passwords on this list, but not all of them. One of the passwords is this:


1wHdeyTXkU+EuZWDuZUT8WVm1jM=


Now, I know that password is, now at least, actually: password1234


I have no idea how to figure out how one equals the other. When I put the 1wHdeyTXkU+EuZWDuZUT8WVm1jM= in any of the 'check this hash' websites, they are unable to determine what it is.


An interesting caveat about this program, it was touted as 'just remember this one password' -- I also know what that one password is, but at a certain point the whole salting and hashing thing is just above my pay grade.


I don't want to send this file out, obviously it contains sensitive information. I just want a direction to go. I tried hashcat earlier today but as I don't know what kind of encryption/hash this is, I was unable to use it. The usernames are largely different lengths and bits. 


The password list itself starts at this line, which I am willing to provide as I don't believe it gives any information that is useful without the rest of it:


12;0:YXBw:owner2:fec541317157cfb7992b7f483a6f783f1bdb0b73e78e3435d00a54067f637aa7:bnVsbA==;app


I have figured out that:


YXBw is Base64 for app


fec541317157cfb7992b7f483a6f783f1bdb0b73e78e3435d00a54067f637aa7 is SHA256 for hunter0704 <- that is the master password if it matters. Also, none of the other username or passwords are recognized as SHA256. 


The list itself starts at that line, then goes sequentially from 1 to 15, then each row is an odd number from there to 83. I am unsure why. 


Any advice you fine folks can give would be very helpful. Also if this is a lost cause, please let me know. It's an exercise in learning and trying to be helpful to the client. At the very least, I was able to provide him a list of the entries he had so he knows which passwords he needs to reset.

While it is certainly true that you should not try to sell your crypto as secure, lots of the projects that get posted and promptly degraded are for novelty purposes only.  Somebody tried to better their understanding of the world around them, let's not shame these people unless it's necessary.

We're all semi intelligent around here, obviously hazing the new blood with this kind of behavior will only serve to dissuade tomorrows experts from even learning the basics.

I'd like to put forth a motion for the mods to consider ""Don't roll your own crypto"" posts as low effort and offtopic.  Moreover I think we should make it a point to encourage youth to do more.  Every bad implementation will also give people that break encryption as amateurs something to do.

Thank you for your time.


**FinalEdit1:** This kind of thought is exactly what I'm trying to avoid both today and in the future. Amateurs cryptographers are not to blame for bad software and more importantly the end users lack of decision making skills. https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/3s5myl/meta_why_are_we_consistently_telling_new_and/cwuib73  I have nothing more to say about this other than I hope I've provided food for thought and if not today maybe someday we can make it a rule to not witch-hunt our own.

**FinalEdit2:** I am tired. https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/3s5myl/meta_why_are_we_consistently_telling_new_and/cwwo0zp is why this is an issue. Just note that there have been no convincing arguments as to why we should witch-hunt.  I mean...those primes in the linked github search are all the freakin' same.

**Really the final edit** https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/3s5myl/meta_why_are_we_consistently_telling_new_and/cwwrj4m the outcome of two days worth of arguing on the internet.  Thank you natanael, I am happy that the disfunction I see is at least on your mind.  Thank you.",2015-11-09 19:27:32

I used [this guide](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x) to create my PGP key, and I got as far as creating it with GPG Keychain. There are further instructions for configuring Thunderbird to use encryption which I'm going to do shortly, but right now I'm trying to figure out something even more basic: like where do I find my actual key and how do I publish it somewhere?

After I created the key in this program, it gives me a ""key id"" number and a longer ""fingerprint"" number. Also, when I created it I checked off the box saying ""upload public key,"" but where exactly is it uploaded to? I'd like to upload it to [this MIT server](https://pgp.mit.edu/) so I can link people to it there, but I don't know how to access the long string of numbers making up my actual key. (The number they're looking for in that box saying ascii-armored pgp key--I'm assuming that's not just the ID or the fingerprint.)

For many months, now, the developers have been working through a slow and careful upgrade of some of the [ciphers](https://geti2p.net/en/docs/how/cryptography) used in the various components of the network. Note that none of the devs are actual cryptographers (though several have a decently strong working knowledge of the tools and principles), and the ""Security/Crypto"" position on [the team](https://geti2p.net/en/about/team) is currently vacant.

They started the cipher migration with the signature schemes, which have now been upgraded to ECDSA as a ""stepping stone"" towards EdDSA, from the former DSA.

Now, work on upgrading the asymmetric crypto has started in earnest, and a recent post by the Lead Developer of the project, zzz, suggests to me that **they could use some friendly consultation, even in brief**. Here's zzz's post copied in full - unfortunately, the original is only available via the I2P network itself at http://zzz.i2p/topics/1768-new-asymmetric-crypto (there is [a working I2P-to-""clearnet"" gateway](http://www.i2p.us), but it has been disabled for the developer forum) - I will be glad to relay any useful comments from here back onto the actual forum, if you'd rather not bother setting up I2P yourself (though I highly recommend checking it out!):

>2014 was the year we implemented new signature encryption algorithms and started the migration to them.

>2015 will be the same thing for asymmetric crypto, hopefully.  
>  
>Asymmetric crypto is used in tunnel building and garlic messages, and (related) DH.  
>  
>I've started a little research and here are my initial findings:  
>  
>-----------------  
>  
>0) The Key Certificate scheme allows for specifying the asymmetric crypto type also. Yay us, that's a start, but there's much more to do. We need a new LeaseSet format (""LS2"") to specify it there also. (Remember, the crypto key in the dest is unused).  
>  
>1) Any encryption of a 222-byte or smaller plain text really needs to be 512 bytes or less. This is the size of our ElG encrypted block, used in Tunnel Build Messages and Garlic Messages. Increasing the size of these would be miserable.  
>  
>2) I always thought that an ElGamal encrypted block was double the size of the plaintext, and that's why we went from 222 to 512. But no. It's twice the size of the key (currently 256 bytes). So longer ElGamal keys, while it would be trivial from an encryption/decryption implementation standpoint, and already specified in RFC 3526, would not be easy.  
>  
>3) There's nothing helpful in the standard Java providers. We will either have to start bundling the Bouncy Castle Provider for everybody, or our own code.  
>  
>4) I tested the BC ElGamal implementation. It's compatible with ours. BC encryption is about 20% slower. BC decryption is about 6x slower. Not surprising since we use jbigi. This really isn't relevant to any of the above, but now it's written down somewhere.  
>  
>5) In addition to ElGamal, BC supports RSA and NTRU for asymmetric, and ECIES, which is EC Integrated Encryption System, i.e. asymmetric + symmetric + MAC, kindof what we do with ElG + AES + SHA256.  
>  
>6) As we all know, RSA is super slow and has huge keys. It is not an option.  
>  
>7) Str4d brought NTRU to our attention a year ago in this post.  
>  
>8) Ideally we should also think of what is available in crypto++ to make things easier for i2pd.  
>  
>9) Crypto++ ECIES is incompatible with BC ECIES, although a crypto++ patch is available ref  
>  
>10) Asymmetric crypto could be related to NTCP2 as we need to pick a new DH, which could (must?) use a similar algorithm.  
>  
>---------------  
>  
>Next steps:  
>  
>1) Look at NTRU. How big are the keys, how big is the ciphertext, how fast/slow is it in BC implementation and the code on github. Edit: Holy shit a 256-bit-level NTRU key is 8173 bits ""optimized"", that's 1022 bytes (ref). This would increase RIs and leasesets by about 768 bytes.  
>  
>2) Is ECIES a realistic option? I assume we can pull out just the asymmetric part if we want also. Is that part the same as ""plain"" EC asymmetric, or the asymmetric part of ECDH, or is there such a thing?  
>  
>3) I assume EC 25519 is also an option? EC 25519 DH?

"Doing an AMA tomorrow 4/27 @ 1pm EST: ""Ex-NSA Math guys prepping for post-quantum crypto-hellscape""",70,67qmw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/67qmw7/doing_an_ama_tomorrow_427_1pm_est_exnsa_math_guys/,18,1493265595.0,"[Quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) is a completely different paradigm from classical computing, where weird quantum properties are combined with traditional boolean logic to create something entirely new. There has long been much doubt about whether it was even possible to build one large enough to solve practical problems. But when something is labeled ""impossible"", of course many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians eagerly respond with ""[Hold my beer!](http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hold-my-beer-14.jpg)"". QCs have an immense potential to make a global impact (for the better!) by solving some of the world's most difficult computational problems, but they would also crush the math problems underpinning much of today's internet security, an unprecedented challenge to cryptography researchers to develop and standardize new [quantum-resistant primitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) for post-quantum internet.

A coworker and I will be doing an AMA tomorrow at 1pm EDT to talk about post-quantum crypto. We are mathematicians that trained in crypto at NSA and worked there for over 10 years. For the past year or so we've been working at a small crypto sw/hw company called [Envieta Systems](http://envieta.com/) on a post-quantum research effort, and we've been reading a broad spectrum of the current research.

Disclaimer: We are bound by [lifetime NSA obligations](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/prepub/), so expect very limited responses about our time at NSA unless you're willing to wait a few weeks for a response from pre-pub review (seriously, I'm joking, we don't want to go through that hassle).

Edit: Forgot the time (and don't know my DST either)

They apparently haven't studied the security of the libraries they have chosen, so don't interpret that as a stamp of approval. It's a weak endorsement at best (that nevertheless makes me happy).

Anyway, here's what they say about [Monocypher](https://monocypher.org):

> Monocypher[63] is a small auditable library implementing the ed25519 signature scheme among other cryptographic primitives. It aims to keep the code base small while not sacrificing too much speed. In this paper, we evaluate versionMonocypher-2.0.5.

Looks they copied my pitch. :-)

> While not being specifically optimized for embedded systems, Monocypher performs the fastest ed25519 signature operations on all of the hardware we tested, but requires two to five times more stack and flash memory compared to C25519.

When you look at the actual numbers, you indeed see that Monocypher is *much* faster than the other Ed25519 implementations: 7 times as fast as the second fastest on Cortex M0, 20 times on M3, _28_ times on M4. This goes beyond my wildest dreams, I would have never expected that. (I'm mighty jealous of qDSA, though).

On the other hand, Monocypher's stack usage is unreasonable: 5 freaking kilobytes! Unreleased improvements (visible on the Git repository) chopped off over 2kB. Still not ideal (we have a little under 3kB left), but enough to be the difference between _""damn that's fast""_ and _""stack overflow, can't use""_ in many cases.

Flash size on the other hand is pretty much unfixable. Monocypher is fast, but that required the code to be clever —and therefore bigger. This might dominate update time if the bandwidth is low enough. (Or we could just not update the crypto library: Monocypher is pretty stable.)

It would seem my crypto library has found its niche: small (but not tiny) embedded devices. And you can still use Libsodium on the server side for maximum performance (Libsodium is between [2.5 to 4 times as fast](https://monocypher.org/speed) as Monocypher on x86-64). Using my most direct competitor as a selling point, isn't that quaint…",2019-07-25 13:40:36

Open source developer Leah Neukirchen found an old BSD passwd file from 1980 containing DES and crypt hashed passwords for many of the old Unix white beards, including Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, Steve Bourne, and Bill Joy. 

DES and crypt are very weak by modern standards, so [she decided to crack them](https://leahneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2019/10/ken-thompson-s-unix-password.html). Ken Thompson's turned out to be the hardest by far. It was: p/q2-q4!

Don't ask me why there was a passwd file checked into the source tree. I find that the strangest part of the whole story.

# Background

Many databases use auto-incrementing primary keys to identify records. This is extremely convenient for many reasons but has some security drawbacks:

- Leaks information (e.g. record count, lexicographic ordering of records)
- URLs containing such identifiers are guessable

The latter has been a longstanding source of problems, such as [leaking the e-mail addresses of all iPad users](https://gawker.com/5559346/apples-worst-security-breach-114000-ipad-owners-exposed) to the recent [""Zoom Bombing""](https://threatpost.com/fbi-threatens-zoom-bombing-trolls-with-jail-time/154495/) problem.

Many schemes exist to ""mask""/""encrypt"" integers. These range from awful (e.g. fixed XOR mask) to slightly less awful (AES in ECB mode). AES-SID provides a scheme using authenticated encryption, ensuring identifiers are non-malleable and therefore offer the attacker only chance advantage at guessing one correctly.

# Construction

AES-SID is an *experimental* scheme I started working on as a ""pandemic project"" shortly before the ""Zoom Bombing"" phenomenon started gaining a lot of attention, which so happens to be potentially applicable to solving it. Zoom URLs are low-entropy and easily guessable/enumerable (among other issues), problems which can be addressed by converting them into higher entropy uniformly random IDs. By using a deterministic ID encryption scheme for this purpose, the encrypted IDs can be *serialized as UUIDs* in a way that's straightforward to retrofit onto systems based on integer primary keys.

AES-SID is a simplification of the original AES-SIV ""key wrapping"" scheme designed by Phil Rogaway and described in the paper and described in the paper [The SIV Mode of Operation for Deterministic Authenticated-Encryption (Key Wrap) and Misuse-Resistant Nonce-Based Authenticated-Encryption](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/siv.pdf).

Here is a pseudocode description of the scheme ([see the project repo for a full comparison of AES-SIV vs AES-SID](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/aes-sid#construction)):

    enc_key = KDF(key, 0, Kenclen)
    prf_key = KDF(key, Kenclen, Ktotal)
    siv = PRF(prf_key, plaintext)[0..8bytes]
    ciphertext = siv || AES-CTR(enc_key, siv, plaintext)

Where the terms (not already described above) are as follows:

- `KDF`: key derivation function. AES-SID uses a [CTR_DRBG]-style KDF, name the one described in [RFC 8452 Section 4] as used by AES-GCM-SIV
- `PRF`: pseudorandom function. AES-SID replaces the vectorized PRF used above with a single-input PRF: [CMAC], making it deterministic. AES-SID as instantiated with CMAC can be more specifically described as AES-CMAC-SID. It could potentially be instantiated with another secure PRF (e.g. HMAC-SHA-256).
- `siv`: PRF output truncated to 8-bytes (64-bits)
- `plaintext`: the little endian encoding of an unsigned 64-bit integer
- `ciphertext`: a 128-bit uniformly random deterministic encryption of the plaintext value comprising a 64-bit dual purpose IV/message authenticator and 64-bit AES-CTR encryption of the plaintext

[CMAC]: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38b/final
[CTR_DRBG]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_SP_800-90A#CTR_DRBG

Reddit Modern Cryptography Tutorial (RMCT) - Series Announcement,62,euosn,https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/euosn/reddit_modern_cryptography_tutorial_rmct_series/,12,1293950876.0,"After reading the recent discussions about what people would like to see this subreddit cover, it appears that a large proportion of (commenting) users are relatively inexperienced with regards to cryptography but appear willing to learn.

Because of this, I have decided to make this pseudonym account to hopefully guide you through the process of learning modern cryptography.  I aim to do this through a series of posts to this subreddit.

Now I already know that there are numerous 'Introduction to Cryptography' tutorials available on the net.  These appear in various forms including audio, video and lecture notes.  However, my aim is to guide this series based primarily on feedback from other users, making this a much more 'interactive' tutorial than the existing static 'one-way' methods.  I will refer to other materials where appropriate and I think they are of good quality.

I aim to require as little prerequisite knowledge as possible, as I will try to explain everything as the series of posts progresses and the topics arise.  Some of the topics I hope to cover include:

* Symmetric block ciphers.
* Block cipher modes of operation.
* Methods of cryptanalysis (including linear and differential cryptanalysis).
* Hash functions.
* Message Authentication Codes (MACs).
* Asymmetric encryption schemes.
* Implementing cryptography.
* Breaking cryptographic implementations.

I *do not* aim to cover what cryptography is nor cryptography in a historical context.  This is a topic that has been covered many times and the Wikipedia pages for these are pretty good (links: [Cryptography](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cryptography) and [History of Cryptography](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/History_of_cryptography))

However, I feel that I must warn you that some of the topics we will (hopefully) cover may be advanced and require time to think about.  Unfortunately, there is no way around this, but each person may pick and choose which areas they would like to research more thoroughly.

For those that are wondering about myself and my motivations for doing this: cryptography is a major hobby of mine and I have spent a number of years working on the topic.  I feel that cryptography is one of the few areas where multiple interesting topics (such as computer security, mathematics, computer programming and privacy) all mix together and interact.

Thus, I hope users on this subreddit will appreciate this method of learning and the process will be enjoyable for everyone involved.  Please give feedback on the posts I write as this is extremely valuable.  Let me know if you think the topic is not explained adequately, too difficult, too detailed, requires too much prerequisite knowledge etc.  I will also attempt to answer questions where I can.

Please note that I am doing this in my limited spare time and so I cannot guarantee timely updates or even guarantee that the series will run for any significant period of time.  All I can commit to is that I will give it my best shot with the time I have available.
